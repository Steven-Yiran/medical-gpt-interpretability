    "context": "the aim of this study was to analyze the properties of the immune cell microenvironment of regional lymph nodes (lns) positive for lung cancer.the presence of metastases correlated with the downregulation of tcr zeta, especially cd8(+) t cells. the most striking feature was the reduction in the number of myeloid cd11c(+) dendritic cells in the ln of patients with ln metastases. this could be a reflection of the immunodeficient state observed in lung cancer patients. even in the absence of metastases in the regional ln, the same type of changes in the ln microenvironment were observed in those ln located nearer the primary tumor."

    "context": "studies have linked ethnic differences in depression rates with neighbourhood ethnic density although results have not been conclusive. we looked at this using a novel approach analysing whole population data covering just over one million gp patients in four london boroughs.black and minority ethnic groups are up to four times less likely to be newly diagnosed with depression or prescribed antidepressants compared to white british patients. we found an inverse relationship between neighbourhood ethnic density and new depression diagnosis for some groups, where an increase of 10% own-ethnic density was associated with a statistically significant (p<0.05) reduced odds of depression for pakistani [odds ratio (or) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.70-0.93], indian (or 0.88, ci 0.81-0.95), african (or 0.88, ci 0.78-0.99) and bangladeshi (or 0.94, ci 0.90-0.99) patients. black caribbean patients, however, showed the opposite effect (or 1.26, ci 1.09-1.46). the results for antidepressant use were very similar although the corresponding effect for black caribbeans was no longer statistically significant (p = 0.07)."

    "context": "it was the aim of the present study to elaborate criteria for the assessment of rapid hemodynamic progression of valvar aortic stenosis. these criteria are of special importance when cardiac surgery is indicated for other reasons but the established criteria for aortic valve replacement are not yet fulfilled. such aspects of therapeutic planing were mostly disregarded in the past so that patients had to undergo cardiac reoperation within a few years.the progression rate of aortic valve obstruction was found to be dependent on the degree of valvar calcification ([vc] scoring 0 to iii) and to be exponentially correlated with the aortic valve opening area (ava) at initial catheterization. neither age nor sex of the patient nor etiology of the valvar obstruction significantly influence the progression of aortic stenosis. if ava decreases below 0.75 cm(2) with a present degree of vc = 0, or ava of 0.8 with vc of i, ava of 0.9 with vc of ii, or ava of 1.0 with vc of iii, it is probable that aortic stenosis will have to be operated upon in the following years."
