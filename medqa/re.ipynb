The pain radiates to the epigastric area. He has a 5-year history of untreated hypertension.

An autopsy is performed and a histologic stained section of the brain is shown in the image. Which of the following receptors are targeted by the pathogen most likely responsible for this patient’s condition? (A) CCR5 (B) Acetylcholine receptor (C) ICAM-1 (D) GABA ASSISTANT: \n",

       "- He has a history of hypertension.\n",

       "Rabies virus primarily infects neurons and utilizes the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) at the neuromuscular junction as a entry point into the central nervous system. After the virus enters the CNS, it causes encephalitis and the described symptoms.\n",
