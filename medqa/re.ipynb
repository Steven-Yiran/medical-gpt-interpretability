       "USER: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of itchy, watery eyes for the past week. He has also been sneezing multiple times a day during this period. He had a similar episode 1 year ago around springtime. He has iron deficiency anemia and ankylosing spondylitis. Current medications include ferrous sulfate, artificial tear drops, and indomethacin. He works as an elementary school teacher. His vital signs are within normal limits. Visual acuity is 20/20 without correction. Physical examination shows bilateral conjunctival injection with watery discharge. The pupils are 3 mm, equal, and reactive to light. Examination of the anterior chamber of the eye is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment? (A) Erythromycin ointment (B) Ketotifen eye drops (C) Warm compresses (D) Fluorometholone eye drops ASSISTANT: \n",
       "A 35-year-old man is presenting with itchy, watery eyes and sneezing, symptoms that are likely due to allergies, especially given their recurrence during a specific time of the year (springtime) which suggests seasonal allergies. His physical examination is consistent with conjunctivitis, as indicated by the bilateral conjunctival injection with watery discharge. His history of iron deficiency anemia and ankylosing spondylitis, as well as the current medications he is taking, are not directly related to his current symptoms of itchy and watery eyes.\n",

       "Treatment options:\n",
       "(A) Erythromycin ointment is an antibiotic and would be appropriate for bacterial conjunctivitis, but there's no evidence of bacterial infection, and his symptoms are more consistent with allergic conjunctivitis.\n",
       "(B) Ketotifen eye drops are a mast cell stabilizer and are used to treat allergic conjunctivitis, which seems to be the cause of this patient's symptoms.\n",
       "(C) Warm compresses may provide symptomatic relief for some forms of conjunctivitis, but they are not the primary treatment for allergic conjunctivitis, especially in acute settings.\n",
       "(D) Fluorometholone eye drops are corticosteroid drops that are generally used for inflammatory conditions of the eye, but not typically for initial treatment of allergic conjunctivitis due to the risk of side effects, particularly with prolonged use.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the most likely diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis and the available treatment options, the best choice for this patient would be the medication that specifically addresses the allergic component of his symptoms.
