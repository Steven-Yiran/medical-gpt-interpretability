The patient's history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common cause of ureteral obstruction in men, particularly in those over the age of 50. BPH can cause the prostate gland to enlarge, compressing the ureter and preventing urine from flowing normally into the bladder. This can lead to dilation of the ureter and renal pelvis, as seen in this patient's ultrasound. \n\nRenal artery stenosis (A) would more likely cause hypertension and possibly renal dysfunction, but not typically ureteral dilation. A common iliac artery aneurysm (C) could cause lower extremity symptoms due to peripheral artery disease, but would not directly cause ureteral obstruction. A urethral stricture (D) could cause obstructive urinary symptoms, but would more likely cause symptoms of urinary retention or difficulty starting urination, rather than flank pain and ureteral dilation.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00007", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

After a detailed study of the virus and its life cycle, he proposes a theory: Initially, a host cell is co-infected with 2 viruses from the same virus family. Within the host cell, concomitant production of various genome segments from both viruses occurs. Ultimately, the different genome segments from the viruses are packaged into a unique and novel virus particle. The newly formed virus particle is both stable and viable and is a new strain from the virus family that caused the outbreak of infection.

The pain is sharp, severe, increases when lying down, and improves with leaning forward. The pain also radiates to his shoulders and neck. The patient has no past medical history. He has smoked 10 cigarettes per day for the past 7 years and occasionally drinks alcohol. He presents with vital signs: blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, regular radial pulse of 95/min, and temperature 37.3\u00b0C (99.1\u00b0F).

These symptoms are consistent with benzodiazepine intoxication, especially given the patient's presentation with an ataxic gait. The blood alcohol concentration of 0.04% is below the typical threshold for significant impairment. The patient's normal pupils and lack of abnormalities on the ECG also make ethanol intoxication less likely. Cannabis intoxication typically presents with euphoria, altered perception, and decreased coordination, but the patient's symptoms do not match this profile. Hypoglycemia could cause altered mental status, but the patient's normal blood pressure and lack of other symptoms such as tremors or sweating make it less likely.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00020", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The presence of basal crackles on the right side of the chest and a new consolidation on the chest radiography indicates a lower respiratory tract infection, likely pneumonia.\n\nGiven the patient's age and the presentation of pneumonia, the most likely causal microorganism is Staphylococcus aureus, especially considering that he has been hospitalized for a week. Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia, particularly in patients with underlying conditions such as stroke.\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae (A) is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia but less likely in this hospital-acquired setting. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (B) is unlikely as it typically presents with chronic symptoms and would not be a primary concern in this acute setting.

He has not had a fever, cough, vomiting, or diarrhea. He has asthma and eczema. He uses a glucocorticoid inhaler and an albuterol inhaler but has missed his medications for the past week while on vacation. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 100/80. Expiratory and inspiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. There are moderate intercostal and subcostal retractions and a decreased inspiratory to expiratory ratio. Nebulized albuterol and ipratropium treatments and intravenous methylprednisolone are given in the emergency department for a presumed asthma exacerbation. One hour later, the child is limp and lethargic. Magnesium sulfate is administered. His temperature is 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse is 150/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 100/70. No wheezing is heard on repeat pulmonary examination. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (A) Intubate with mechanical ventilation (B) Perform needle thoracostomy at the 2nd intercostal space (C) Perform bronchoscopy (D) Provide additional dose of methylprednisolone The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D]\n\nExplanation: The child's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a severe asthma exacerbation, which was initially treated with nebulized albuterol, ipratropium, and intravenous methylprednisolone. However, the child's sudden deterioration after treatment, characterized by limpness, lethargy, and a significant decrease in respiratory rate, is concerning for a life-threatening complication of asthma, known as status asthmaticus or asthma-related respiratory failure.\n\nThe administration of magnesium sulfate is appropriate in this scenario, as it is a bronchodilator and can help to reduce the severity of asthma symptoms. However, the child's continued respiratory failure and lack of response to treatment warrant further intervention.\n\nOption A, intubation with mechanical ventilation, is the most appropriate next step in management. The child's respiratory rate has decreased, but his respiratory status is still compromised, and he requires close monitoring and support. Intubation and mechanical ventilation will allow for the maintenance of adequate oxygenation and ventilation, which is critical in this scenario.\n\nOption B, needle thoracostomy at the 2nd intercostal space, is not indicated in this scenario, as there is no evidence of a pneumothorax.\n\nOption C, bronchoscopy, may be useful in certain cases of asthma exacerbation, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario, where the child is showing signs of respiratory failure.\n\nOption D, providing an additional dose of methylprednisolone, may be beneficial in the management of asthma exacerbation, but it does not address the child's immediate need for respiratory support and close monitoring.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00025", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The weakness is more noticeable when climbing stairs and combing hair. The weakness improves after brief exercise. She also has bladder incontinence for the past 4 weeks and was given an anticholinesterase agent with no improvement. What is the most likely cause of the symptoms? (A) Duchenne muscular dystrophy (B) Hypothyroidism (C) Myasthenia gravis (D) Paraneoplastic syndrome from small cell carcinoma of the lung The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[C] \n\nRationale: \n\nThe patient's symptoms of weakness that improves after brief exercise, particularly with activities that require sustained muscle contraction (climbing stairs and combing hair), are classic for myasthenia gravis (MG). MG is an autoimmune disease characterized by antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor, which leads to impaired neuromuscular transmission and muscle weakness. The weakness in MG typically worsens with prolonged use and improves with rest. The patient's bladder incontinence and failure to respond to anticholinesterase therapy (which is commonly used to treat overactive bladder) further supports the diagnosis of MG. \n\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder that typically presents in childhood with progressive muscle weakness and degeneration. Hypothyroidism can cause muscle weakness, but it is typically more diffuse and not as specific as the symptoms described. Paraneoplastic syndrome from small cell carcinoma of the lung can cause a variety of neurological symptoms, but the pattern of weakness and bladder incontinence described is more typical of MG.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00037", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

After acute treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the patient is able to recover most of his speech. Subsequent neurologic exam finds that the patient is fluent while speaking and is able to comprehend both one and two step instructions. Noticeably the patient remains unable to complete tasks involving verbal repetition. Residual damage to which of the following structures is most likely responsible for this patient's syndrome? (A) Arcuate fasciculus (B) Superior temporal gyrus (C) Inferior frontal gyrus + superior temporal gyrus (D) Arcuate fasciculus + inferior frontal gyrus + superior temporal gyrus The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe answer is A.\n\nThis patient's presentation is consistent with a syndrome known as transcortical motor aphasia (also known as Broca's aphasia without Broca's area damage). The patient has fluent speech but difficulty with verbal repetition, which is a hallmark of transcortical motor aphasia. This type of aphasia is often associated with damage to the arcuate fasciculus, a bundle of fibers that connects the frontal and temporal lobes, particularly the inferior frontal gyrus and the superior temporal gyrus. However, in this case, the damage is likely isolated to the arcuate fasciculus, as the patient is able to recover most of his speech with tPA treatment and has preserved comprehension.\n\nThe arcuate fasciculus plays a crucial role in the integration of language processing between the frontal and temporal lobes, and damage to this structure can lead to difficulties with verbal repetition, as seen in this patient. The other options are not as likely, as damage to the superior temporal gyrus (option B) or the inferior frontal gyrus + superior temporal gyrus (option C) would be more consistent with Wernicke's aphasia or a mixed non-fluent aphasia, respectively. Option D is also incorrect, as damage to all three structures would likely result in a more severe language disorder.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00040", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

These symptoms started slowly about 2 weeks ago and have become more pronounced, but they do not seem to bother the patient. He resides in an inpatient psychiatric facility where he has been successfully treated with haloperidol for the past several months. His physical exam and vitals are within normal limits.

Tardive dyskinesia is a side effect of long-term use of antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol, which the patient has been taking for several months. It is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary, repetitive movements that can be difficult to treat. The patient's symptoms started slowly over 2 weeks, which is consistent with the development of tardive dyskinesia. \n\nB Acute dystonia is a side effect of antipsychotic medications that occurs within the first few days of treatment and is characterized by involuntary muscle contractions. It is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.\n\nC Pseudoparkinsonism is a side effect of antipsychotic medications that mimics Parkinson's disease, but it is not characterized by the symptoms described in the patient.\n\nD Palsy is a general term that refers to a condition characterized by weakness or paralysis of a muscle or group of muscles.

He says this started during summer workouts leading up to this season. He denies having any rash anywhere else on his body. The blood pressure is 123/78 mm Hg, pulse is 67/min, respiratory rate is 15/min, and temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (98.7\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals an erythematous, well-demarcated patch with peripheral scale on the left thigh, pubic region, and perineum. There is no apparent scrotal involvement with the rash. How can you confirm the suspected diagnosis? (A) KOH examination of lesion scrapings (B) Nikolsky's sign on physical exam (C) Gram stain of skin scrapings (D) AFB stain of skin scrapings The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] AFB stain of skin scrapings.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of an infection caused by Mycobacterium marinum, a type of nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM). M. marinum infections are often seen in individuals who engage in aquatic activities or have skin trauma, and they can cause skin lesions that resemble those described in the scenario. The erythematous, well-demarcated patch with peripheral scale is consistent with a \"swimming pool granuloma\" or \"fish tank granuloma.\"\n\nThe diagnosis of M. marinum infection can be confirmed by culturing the organism from skin scrapings or by performing an acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain on skin scrapings. This is the correct answer.\n\nKOH examination of lesion scrapings (A) is typically used to diagnose fungal infections, such as tinea corporis or ringworm. Nikolsky's sign (B) is a clinical sign that is often used to diagnose conditions such as pemphigus or staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, but it is not a diagnostic test. Gram stain of skin scrapings (C) is used to diagnose bacterial infections, but it would not be the best choice for diagnosing an NTM infection.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00056", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

This is due to its antagonism of dopamine receptors, which can lead to an increase in prolactin levels. Agranulocytosis is a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect associated with clozapine, another atypical antipsychotic, but not typically with risperidone. Shortened QT interval is not a common side effect of risperidone, and in fact, some antipsychotics can prolong the QT interval.

In TSS, the staphylococcal superantigen, Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin-1 (TSST-1), binds to the V\u03b2 region of the T cell receptor, leading to an excessive activation of T cells, which in turn causes a massive release of cytokines and a systemic inflammatory response.\n\nSo, the correct answer is: [B]<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00058", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He feels well and currently drinks 5 glasses of wine each night. Medications include atenolol and lisinopril. On physical exam, temperature is 98.1 deg F (36.7 deg C), blood pressure is 151/82 mmHg, pulse is 71/min, and respirations are 14/min. He has spider angiomata on his chest; no asterixis, jaundice, ascites, or peripheral edema is noted. Screening ultrasound reveals a new liver nodule, and follow up CT demonstrates a 2 cm right hepatic lobe lesion with enhancement in the arterial phase. No hypodense attenuation is seen on the venous or delayed phase. What is the next step in management? (A) Proceed with liver biopsy (B) Refer for surgical resection (C) Refer for radiofrequency ablation (D) Observe and get follow-up imaging in 3 months The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] Observe and get follow-up imaging in 3 months.\n\nExplanation: The patient has a new liver nodule, which could be a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or a benign lesion. The key findings that suggest a benign lesion are:\n\n- The patient has cirrhosis due to alcoholic liver disease, which is a common cause of HCC.\n- The patient is drinking 5 glasses of wine per night, which is a significant amount of alcohol consumption.\n- The patient has spider angiomata, which is a sign of liver disease.\n\nHowever, the liver nodule shows arterial enhancement without venous or delayed phase attenuation, which is more suggestive of a hemangioma or a focal nodular hyperplasia rather than HCC. Given the patient's age and underlying liver disease, a conservative approach would be to observe and get follow-up imaging in 3 months to monitor the lesion for any changes. \n\nLiver biopsy is not recommended as the first step, as it carries a risk of bleeding in a patient with cirrhosis. Surgical resection or radiofrequency ablation would be premature without a definitive diagnosis of HCC.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00070", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The patient\u2019s wife says that he has been sleeping much more than usual for the past 5 days. His bowel and bladder habit have not changed. His past medical history is significant for alcoholic liver cirrhosis. His vital signs include: pulse 76/min, respiratory rate 15/min, temperature 38.0\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and blood pressure 122/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient is altered and not responsive to commands. Oriented x 0. The abdomen is significantly distended. Shifting dullness is present and a positive fluid wave can be elicited. Hyperreflexia and asterixis are noted. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:\nLaboratory test\nSodium 140 mEq/L\nPotassium 3.5 mEq/L\nChloride 97 mEq/L\nGlucose 90 mg/dL\nAmmonia 100 \u00b5g/dL (ref: 19-60 \u00b5g/dL)\nArterial blood gas\npH 7.4\npCO2 40 mm Hg\npO2 90 mm Hg\nHCO3 26 mEq/L\nAn abdominal ultrasound shows surface nodularity compatible with cirrhosis but no other changes aside from ascites. An upper GI endoscopy is performed which shows gastric varices with no signs of active bleeding. An MRI of the brain is insignificant. What is the most likely precipitating factor that led to this patient\u2019s condition? (A) Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (B) Metabolic alkalosis (C) Portal vein thrombosis (D) Hypoglycemia The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[A] \n\nThe patient has a history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis, and the symptoms and laboratory findings suggest that he has developed hepatic encephalopathy. The presence of ascites, altered mental status, asterixis, and hyperreflexia are all consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.\n\nThe laboratory findings show elevated ammonia levels (100 \u00b5g/dL), which is a known precipitating factor for hepatic encephalopathy. The most common precipitating factors for hepatic encephalopathy are:\n\n1. Infection (e.g., spontaneous bacterial peritonitis)\n2. Gastrointestinal bleeding\n3. Constipation\n4. Electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hyponatremia)\n5. Sedatives or other medications\n\nIn this case, the patient has ascites and gastric varices, which increases the risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). SBP is a known precipitating factor for hepatic encephalopathy, and the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, the most likely precipitating factor that led to this patient's condition is spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00071", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He reports that his symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and he has noticed episodes of diarrhea. He recently started melatonin and magnesium supplementation in hopes of improving his sleep. Medical history is significant for alcohol use disorder that required multiple hospital admissions for management of acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis. He states that he occasionally injects heroin intravenously. Temperature is 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical examination is significant for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory testing is significant for leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A paracentesis is performed and he is admitted into the hospital to receive intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrates a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and a culture positive for Escherichia coli sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. On hospital day 2, the nurse reports that the patient is oliguric in the setting of constant fluid intake. Physical examination is unchanged. Laboratory testing is significant for a serum sodium of 131 mEq/L and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL (it was 0.9 mg/dL on admission). Urine studies are significant for a low urine sodium level, without evidence of blood or protein. Since the hospital admission, he has not been started on any new medications.

The rash is typically characterized by hypopigmented or hyperpigmented patches on the skin, often accompanied by pruritus. Tinea versicolor is common in individuals with diabetes, as they may have altered skin flora.\n\nA Wood lamp examination (A) may be helpful in diagnosing certain fungal infections, but it is not specific for tinea versicolor.\n\nA skin culture (B) may be used to diagnose certain bacterial or fungal infections, but it is not the most appropriate test for tinea versicolor.\n\nA potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation (C) is used to diagnose fungal infections, including tinea versicolor, by demonstrating the presence of fungal hyphae or spores in skin scrapings. However, a KOH preparation is not as definitive as a skin biopsy in confirming the diagnosis.\n\nA skin biopsy (D) is the most definitive test for diagnosing tinea versicolor, as it can demonstrate the presence of Malassezia species in the skin.

She finds it difficult initiating sleep, occasionally has palpitations, and feels fatigued. She denies having similar symptoms in the past or starting any new medications or illicit drugs. She is currently 10 weeks pregnant and is closely followed by her obstetrician. Her temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/70 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 18/min. On physical exam, the patient is mildly diaphoretic. The skin is warm and the thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged with thyroid bruits. Laboratory studies are significant for a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.01 \u00b5U/mL (normal is 0.5-5.0 \u00b5U/mL) and an elevated free thyroxine (FT4) that is inappropriate for her pregnancy. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?

Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy can lead to complications for both the mother and the fetus, including preterm labor, low birth weight, and thyroid storm.\n\nThe recommended treatment for hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is methimazole (MMI) or propylthiouracil (PTU) due to their safety profiles. However, radioiodine therapy and thyroidectomy are contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of fetal thyroid ablation and other complications.\n\nBetween methimazole (A) and propylthiouracil (B), propylthiouracil is typically recommended in the first trimester due to a lower risk of congenital anomalies. However, methimazole is generally preferred in the second and third trimesters due to a lower risk of hepatotoxicity.\n\nTherefore, the best treatment option for this patient is not among the choices given, but in this case, it is best to say the correct answer is not available in the choices given, but generally, the best treatment option is (B) Propylthiouracil in the first trimester and (A) Methimazole in the second and third trimesters.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00090", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Physical exam is notable for an unremarkable HEENT exam with normal facial features and no signs of airway compromise. Neurological exam is remarkable for new onset spasticity. The patient has 3+ reflexes and a positive Babinski sign. Musculoskeletal exam is only notable for symmetric swelling and deformities of the patient\u2019s hands bilaterally. Additionally, there is a \"clunk\" when posterior force is applied to the head while anterior force is applied to the cervical spine.

AAI is a known complication of rheumatoid arthritis, which causes inflammation and subsequent laxity of the ligaments that stabilize the atlantoaxial joint. This condition can lead to spinal cord compression and the symptoms described.\n\nCerebral palsy (A) is a condition that affects movement and muscle tone, but it is not typically associated with atlantoaxial instability.\n\nDiabetes mellitus (B) is a risk factor for various complications, including neuropathy and vascular disease, but it is not directly associated with atlantoaxial instability.\n\nDown syndrome (C) is associated with an increased risk of atlantoaxial instability due to ligamentous laxity, but the patient's past medical history also includes hypertension and diabetes, making rheumatoid arthritis a more likely risk factor given the presence of symmetric swelling and deformities of the hands.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00094", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She says that the chest pain is worse when she breathes or coughs. Furthermore, on the way to the hospital she noticed that there were specks of blood on a tissue that she coughed into. She has no previous medical history and does not recall anything that could have provoked these symptoms. On presentation her temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 107/65 mmHg, pulse is 102/min, respirations are 21/min, and O2 saturation is 91% on room air. Further testing shows a large filling defect in the pulmonary vessels, and the patient is started on an appropriate treatment intravenously. After drug administration, the effects of the drug are monitored using a standard blood test. Surprisingly, the test results come back within normal parameters. The most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms has which of the following modes of inheritance? (A) Autosomal dominant (B) Autosomal partial dominance (C) X-linked dominant (D) X-linked recessive The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the symptoms described, the patient likely has a pulmonary embolism (PE). The presence of shortness of breath, chest pain that worsens with breathing or coughing, and specks of blood on a tissue after coughing are all indicative of a PE. The filling defect in the pulmonary vessels further supports this diagnosis.\n\nGiven that the treatment for PE is often anticoagulation (blood thinners), and the test results come back within normal parameters, it suggests that the patient may be experiencing a paradoxical embolism, where a clot forms in a right-sided cardiac chamber and then crosses over to the left side of the heart, causing a PE.\n\nThe underlying cause of paradoxical embolism is often a patent foramen ovale (PFO), which is a congenital heart defect where a hole in the heart allows blood to flow between the right and left atria. PFO is often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) Autosomal dominant.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00097", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The most appropriate next step is to obtain cervical immobilization to prevent further injury to the cervical spine. This can be achieved with a cervical collar. \n\nA lateral cervical film may be ordered after cervical immobilization to assess for any cervical spine fractures or dislocations. \n\nIV methylprednisolone is typically used in the treatment of acute spinal cord injury, but it is not the initial step in management. \n\nObservation overnight is not appropriate as the initial step, as it may delay diagnosis and treatment of a cervical spine injury.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00099", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He is concerned about abnormal discharge from both nipples over the past 3 months. The fluid is white, and he wonders if it could be milk. On further review of systems, he endorses a diminished sexual drive. The physician suspects that one of the patient's medications may be the culprit for these symptoms.

He had previously been well. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation via uncomplicated vaginal delivery and weighed 3.1 kg (6 lb 13 oz). The mother has no medical insurance and did not receive prenatal care. The newborn's 4-year-old brother has sickle cell disease. Examination shows jaundice. The abdomen is mildly distended. The liver is palpated 1 cm below the right costal margin and the spleen tip is palpated just below the left costal margin. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 11 g/dL\nReticulocytes 9%\nLeukocytes 9,100/mm3\nPlatelets 244,000/mm3\nMaternal blood group 0, Rh-negative\nAnti-Rh antibody titer positive\nFetal blood group B, Rh-negative\nSerum\nBilirubin, total 11.3 mg/dL\nDirect 0.3 mg/dL\nWhich of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?\" (A) RBC sickling (B) Anti-D antibodies (C) Biliary duct malformation (D) Anti-B antibodies The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D]\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe patient's mother is Rh-negative and has a positive anti-Rh antibody titer. The baby is also Rh-negative, but the mother's blood group is 0, and the baby's blood group is B. This situation is known as an Rh-incompatible pregnancy. The mother's immune system has produced anti-Rh antibodies, which are likely causing hemolysis of the baby's red blood cells. The elevated reticulocyte count and low indirect bilirubin suggest hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). The direct bilirubin level is low, which makes a biliary duct malformation less likely. The presence of a mildly distended abdomen and palpable liver and spleen tip suggests hemolysis and the body's attempt to compensate for the loss of red blood cells. \n\nSickle cell disease is less likely because the patient's hemoglobin is within the normal range for a newborn, and the mother's 4-year-old son has sickle cell disease, but the patient does not.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00101", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He notes that this is particularly obvious when he is mowing his lawn or climbing the stairs in his home. His past medical history is significant for hypertension that is well-controlled with lisinopril. His vital signs are as follows: T 37.6 C, HR 88, BP 136/58, RR 18, SpO2 97% RA. Physical examination is significant for an early diastolic blowing, decrescendo murmur heard best at the left sternal border, a midsystolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border, and a late diastolic rumbling murmur heard best at the apex on auscultation. In addition, an S3 heart sound is also present. Bounding pulses are palpated at the radial arteries bilaterally. Which of the following diagnoses is most likely in this patient? (A) Mitral regurgitation (B) Aortic regurgitation (C) Aortic stenosis (D) Mitral prolapse The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B]\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, particularly with exertion, and the physical examination findings of an early diastolic blowing, decrescendo murmur heard best at the left sternal border are characteristic of aortic regurgitation. This murmur is often described as a \"water-hammer\" pulse or \"Corrigan's pulse,\" which is a bounding pulse. The midsystolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border is likely a normal ejection systolic murmur due to the increased flow across the aortic valve. The late diastolic rumbling murmur heard best at the apex is likely an Austin Flint murmur, which is a mid-diastolic rumble heard at the apex in patients with aortic regurgitation. The S3 heart sound is often present in patients with aortic regurgitation due to the increased volume of blood in the ventricle.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00105", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He presents with a 1-year history of worsening shortness of breath and weight loss. He is a former construction worker, and worked in a steel mill when he was in high school. He is an active smoker with a 36-pack-year smoking history. The blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg, pulse rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, and the BMI is 31 kg/m2. The patient is afebrile and the oxygen saturation at rest is 95% on room air. The pulmonary examination reveals a mildly prolonged expiratory phase, and no wheezing or crackles are auscultated. A pulmonary function test is recommended for the patient, and 2 weeks later he returns with a report that shows an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% and FEV1 of 50% of the predicted value. The lung volumes show a total lung capacity of 110% of predicted value, a residual volume of 115% of predicted value, and a DLCO of 60% of predicted value.

The pulmonary function test (PFT) results show a low FEV1/FVC ratio (60%), indicating airway obstruction. The FEV1 is 50% of the predicted value, further supporting this diagnosis. The increased total lung capacity and residual volume are also consistent with airway obstruction, as seen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The DLCO is also decreased, which can occur in COPD due to emphysema. Asbestosis would more likely present with a restrictive pattern on PFTs and a history of asbestos exposure. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis would also present with a restrictive pattern and a history of progressive dyspnea.

(A) Dengue virus (B) Rubella virus (C) Toxoplasmosis (D) Zika virus The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] \n\nReasoning: The patient's symptoms in the 1st trimester, including fevers, headaches, myalgias, arthralgias, and a pruritic maculopapular rash, are consistent with a Zika virus infection. Additionally, the patient's travel to Brazil and lack of use of mosquito repellents increase the likelihood of exposure to the Zika virus. The patient's ultrasound findings of fetal microcephaly are also consistent with a Zika virus infection, as Zika virus has been linked to an increased risk of fetal microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities.

(A) Herniation of the uncus (B) Herniation of the cingulate gyrus (C) Occlusion of the basilar artery (D) Occlusion of the anterior spinal artery The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms, including the non-reactive left pupil, right-sided visual field defect, and hemiparesis on the right side, the most likely explanation is herniation of the uncus.\n\n[A] Herniation of the uncus typically results from increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in the posterior fossa, often due to a supratentorial mass lesion. This can cause compression of the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III), leading to a dilated, non-reactive pupil on the same side as the herniation. The patient's symptoms are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\n[B] Herniation of the cingulate gyrus typically results from increased ICP in the anterior portion of the brain, often due to a frontal lobe lesion. This can cause a contralateral hemiparesis, but it is less likely to cause a dilated, non-reactive pupil.\n\n[C] Occlusion of the basilar artery typically results from an embolic event or atherosclerosis, leading to ischemia of the brainstem, cerebellum, and posterior cerebral arteries. This can cause a range of symptoms, including visual field defects, but it is less likely to cause a dilated, non-reactive pupil.\n\n[D] Occlusion of the anterior spinal artery typically results from an embolic event or atherosclerosis, leading to ischemia of the spinal cord. This can cause a range of symptoms, including weakness or paralysis of the lower extremities, but it is less likely to cause a dilated, non-reactive pupil or a right-sided visual field defect.\n\nThe correct answer is [A].<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00127", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He states that he was resting at home when he noticed he had difficulty reading. Currently, he is also starting to see double, and is seeing two images on top of each other. Earlier today, he felt ill with nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea, which he attributed to food he had eaten at a picnic the day before. When asked which foods he ate, he lists potato salad, a hamburger, deviled eggs, and pickles made by his neighbor. He also heard that his friend who went to the picnic with him has developed similar symptoms and was seen in another hospital earlier. While in the emergency room, the patient\u2019s temperature is 98.4\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), pulse is 75/min, blood pressure is 122/84 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Cranial nerve exam is notable for fixed pupillary dilation, and difficulty depressing both eyes. The remainder of his exam is normal. Which of the following is the pathogenesis of this patient\u2019s presentation? (A) Decreased acetylcholine release (B) Overactivation of adenylate cyclase (C) Release of interferon-gamma (D) Inhibition of GABA release The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[A] Decreased acetylcholine release.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including fixed pupillary dilation, difficulty depressing both eyes, and double vision, are indicative of a condition known as botulism. Botulism is caused by the toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which can be found in improperly preserved or contaminated foods, such as the potato salad and deviled eggs mentioned in the scenario. The toxin works by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in transmitting nerve impulses to muscles, leading to muscle weakness and paralysis. The patient's symptoms are consistent with botulism, and the pathogenesis is due to decreased acetylcholine release.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00130", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The mother has noticed that the girl's stools have become pale over the past week. She was breastfed since birth but her parents switched her to formula feeds recently after reading on the internet that breastfeeding could be the cause of her current symptoms. The patient was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. She appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. She is at the 50th percentile for length and at the 60th percentile for weight. Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Serum studies show:\nBilirubin\nTotal 15 mg/dL\nDirect 12.3 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 2007 U/L\nAST 53 U/L\nALT 45 U/L\n\u03b3-glutamyl transferase 154 U/L\nBlood group A positive\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\" (A) Galactosemia (B) Biliary atresia (C) Crigler\u2013Najjar syndrome (D) Breast milk jaundice The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D]\n\nExplanation: The baby is 4 weeks old, and the jaundice has been increasing over the past 2 weeks. The baby's stools have become pale, which suggests a decrease in conjugated bilirubin (the liver is not excreting bilirubin into the intestine). The liver is palpated at 2 cm below the right costal margin, which is normal for a newborn. The direct bilirubin level is elevated, but not extremely high. The indirect bilirubin is elevated as well, but the total bilirubin level is not extremely high. \n\nGalactosemia (A) would likely present with symptoms such as failure to thrive, lethargy, and vomiting after feeding, which are not mentioned in the case.\n\nBiliary atresia (B) typically presents with pale stools and dark urine, but the bilirubin levels are usually much higher, and the liver is often palpated at a lower level.\n\nCrigler\u2013Najjar syndrome (C) is a rare condition that presents with extremely high levels of unconjugated bilirubin. The bilirubin level in this case is not extremely high.\n\nBreast milk jaundice (D) is a common cause of jaundice in newborns, especially in breastfed babies. The jaundice typically peaks around 7-14 days of age and resolves on its own by 2-4 weeks of age. The baby was breastfed until recently, and the jaundice has been increasing over the past 2 weeks.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00131", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\n(B) Hypothyroidism: This condition is not directly related to the patient's symptoms of left lower quadrant pain and is not supported by the laboratory findings.\n\n(C) Adenocarcinoma of the colon: While this is a possible cause of left lower quadrant pain, it would typically present with more severe symptoms, such as weight loss, changes in bowel habits, and possibly gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's mild symptoms and lack of weight change make this diagnosis less likely.\n\n(D) Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): IBS is a functional disorder characterized by abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, and bloating.

The laboratory results show an elevated 24-hour urinary cortisol and an elevated serum cortisol level, which is not suppressed by the high-dose dexamethasone suppression trial. This suggests that the patient's Cushing's syndrome is caused by an ACTH-independent process, such as an adrenal gland tumor.\n\nThe serum ACTH level is low, which further supports this conclusion. The next best step is to perform inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS), which is a highly sensitive and specific test for identifying the source of ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome. IPSS involves sampling blood from the inferior petrosal sinuses, which drain the pituitary gland, to measure ACTH levels. This can help determine if the Cushing's syndrome is caused by an adrenal gland tumor or another cause.\n\nMRI of the adrenal glands (A) may be useful in identifying an adrenal gland tumor, but it is not the best next step in management. MRI of the chest (B) may be useful in identifying a ectopic source of ACTH, but the patient's low ACTH level makes this less likely. A low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (C) is not useful in this case, as the patient's cortisol levels were not suppressed by the high-dose dexamethasone suppression trial.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00142", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

During this period, she has found it difficult to relax. She states that her head is full of worries. She works at an accountant's office and reports difficulty in concentrating on her work. She has been working longer shifts because one of her coworkers is on vacation and reports feeling more tired than usual. She is married and frequently fights with her husband. The patient states that in order to deal with her stress, she goes shopping. While shopping, she steals small trivial items and feels immediately relieved thereafter. She discards the objects she steals and has feelings of shame and guilt about her actions. Her husband is concerned about her behavior, but she is unable to stop shoplifting. Her vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, she is oriented to person, place, and time. She reports feeling anxious. Physical examination shows no abnormalities.

(A) Administration of lithium (B) Interpersonal therapy (C) Psychodynamic psychotherapy (D) Cognitive behavioral therapy The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] \n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as difficulty relaxing, feeling anxious, difficulty concentrating, and increased irritability, suggest she may be experiencing an anxiety disorder. Her behavior of shoplifting and feeling relieved afterward, along with feelings of shame and guilt, are indicative of a compulsive behavior. These symptoms are characteristic of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which often co-exists with anxiety disorders. The most effective treatment for OCD is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), specifically exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy. This type of therapy helps the patient confront their fears and resist the urge to engage in compulsive behaviors.\n\nLithium is a medication used to treat bipolar disorder and certain other psychiatric conditions, so it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient. Interpersonal therapy (IPT) is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on improving communication and relationships, but it is not the most effective treatment for OCD. Psychodynamic psychotherapy is a type of therapy that explores unconscious thoughts and feelings, but it is not the most effective treatment for OCD.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00148", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Vital signs include: temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100.0\u00b0F), pulse is 98/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. The rash features thin-walled, fluid-filled blisters that rupture easily. Fluid samples from the lesions are sent for analysis to a microbiology lab. The results reveal an infection by the gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus.

The patient's laboratory studies show a mild elevation in leukocyte count, which is consistent with an infectious process. \n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). \n\nLevofloxacin (A) and Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (B) are both effective treatments for CAP, but they are not the most appropriate choices in this case. Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. However, it is not the first-line treatment for CAP. \n\nTrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is effective against Streptococcus pneumoniae, but it is not the first-line treatment for CAP, especially in patients with comorbidities or underlying medical conditions. \n\nAmoxicillin (C) is not the most appropriate choice for CAP, as it is not effective against atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. \n\nRifampin (D) is not typically used as a first-line treatment for CAP, as it is not effective against the most common pathogens that cause CAP. However, it is sometimes used in combination with other antibiotics to treat specific types of pneumonia, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis or nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. \n\nIn this case, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for the patient's CAP would be a beta-lactam antibiotic such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, but since it's not listed among the options, the next best choice would be Levofloxacin (A), however, the best choice given the options is (D) Rifampin<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00151", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The child is clutching his abdomen and crying about pain in his belly. His mother reports intermittent episodes of jaundice with joint and bone pain since he was 5 months old. At presentation, the patient\u2019s vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals slight jaundice and pale conjunctiva. The spleen is tender and easily palpable. After a complete blood count with differential and an abdominal ultrasound, the patient is found to have sickle-cell disease with splenic infarct. A partial splenectomy is performed. After the operation, the physician provides vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

She says the dryness has become so severe that she has difficulty swallowing food. She has a history of hypertension, for which she takes hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), but she has no other medical problems. Family history is significant for her grandmother having systemic lupus erythematosus. The vital signs include: blood pressure 118/76 mm Hg, heart rate 78/min, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical exam, she has tender parotid glands bilaterally and dries mucous membranes. The presence of serum anti-Ro and anti-La autoantibodies is confirmed at high titers. In addition to her primary diagnosis, which of the following is this patient most at risk for developing in the future?

The rash described is characteristic of this condition, with a long erythematous rash covered with multiple clear vesicles and crusty lesions. The involvement of the dermatome, specifically the area from the back to below the right breast, is consistent with herpes zoster affecting the thoracic dermatomes.\n\nThe most likely underlying mechanism of the disease is viral reactivation in dorsal root ganglia. Herpes zoster is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, which initially causes chickenpox. The virus remains latent in the dorsal root ganglia and can reactivate later in life, leading to the characteristic rash and pain of herpes zoster.\n\nThe other options are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and examination findings:\n\n* Option B refers to IgA deposits in the upper dermis, which is characteristic of dermatitis herpetiformis, a skin condition associated with celiac disease.\n* Option C refers to bacterial lymphatic infection of the epidermis, which is characteristic of erysipelas, a type of bacterial skin infection.\n* Option D refers to infestation with bloodsucking parasites, which is characteristic of certain skin conditions such as sandfly fever or leishmaniasis, but not the patient's symptoms.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00165", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

It is determined that patients have a 4-year asymptomatic period prior to developing clinical symptoms from this adrenal cancer. A new screening test is developed, and the cancer can now be detected 2 years prior to developing clinical symptoms.

The elevated antistreptolysin O titer suggests a recent streptococcal infection, and the presence of hematuria, proteinuria, and edema are consistent with kidney involvement.\n\nThe underlying mechanism of PSGN is the formation of antigen-antibody complexes. After the initial streptococcal infection, the immune system produces antibodies against the streptococcal antigens. These antibodies then bind to the antigens in the glomeruli, forming immune complexes. The immune complexes activate the complement system, leading to inflammation and damage to the glomeruli.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the underlying mechanism of PSGN:\n\nA) Antigen-specific IgE binding to mast cells is involved in allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis and asthma.\n\nB) Tissue-specific antibodies are involved in autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia and Goodpasture's syndrome.\n\nD) Presensitized CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity, such as in viral infections and transplant rejection.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00170", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

On questioning by the paramedics, he reported severe chest pain and mild dyspnea. On arrival, he is confused and unable to provide a history. His pulse is 93/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 91/65 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 88%. He is able to move his extremities in response to commands. He opens his eyes spontaneously. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Examination shows multiple bruises over the trunk and extremities. There is a 3-cm (1.2-in) wound at the left fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line. There is jugular venous distention. Decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance on percussion are noted on the left. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

The symptoms include jugular venous distention, decreased breath sounds, and hyperresonance on percussion, which are all indicative of a tension pneumothorax. The patient's oxygen saturation of 88% and the presence of a wound at the left fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line further support this diagnosis.\n\nThe most appropriate next step in management is to perform a needle decompression to relieve the tension pneumothorax and improve the patient's respiratory status. This can be done by inserting a large-bore needle into the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line on the affected side.\n\nA CT scan of the chest (A) may be useful in diagnosing the extent of the injury but is not the most immediate concern in this case.\n\nBronchoscopy (B) is not indicated as an initial step in the management of a tension pneumothorax.\n\nEmergency thoracotomy (C) may be necessary in some cases of severe chest trauma but is not the first step in managing a tension pneumothorax.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00176", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

A clinical research study has enrolled 1,200 patients, half of whom have the disease. The scan is found to be positive in 590 of the 600 patients with known PD, and positive in 20 of the 600 patients without PD. What is the test\u2019s overall specificity?

The patient was a professional athlete who retired at age 50. He also notes morning stiffness in his joints that lasts approx. 50 minutes. He denies joint swelling, color changes in his digits, dryness of mucous membranes, and constitutional symptoms such as fever and chills. On physical exam, the physician notes several non-tender nodules on the left 1st, 3rd, and 4th distal interphalangeal joints. There is also tenderness with palpation at the base of both thumbs. The patient\u2019s knees are enlarged, bilaterally, and he has pain and crepitus on passive range of motion. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Ankylosing spondylitis (B) Gout (C) Osteoarthritis (D) Fibromyalgia The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[C]\n\nRationale: \n\nThis patient presents with a long history of joint pain and morning stiffness lasting approximately 50 minutes, which is a common symptom of osteoarthritis (OA). The patient's history as a professional athlete also supports this diagnosis, as repetitive joint stress can contribute to the development of OA. The presence of non-tender nodules (Heberden's nodes) at the distal interphalangeal joints and tenderness at the base of the thumbs are also characteristic of OA. The patient's enlarged knees with pain and crepitus on passive range of motion further support this diagnosis. Ankylosing spondylitis typically presents with axial symptoms, such as back pain and stiffness, and is less likely to involve the hands and knees in this manner. Gout typically presents with acute, severe joint pain, often accompanied by redness, swelling, and warmth, which is not present in this case. Fibromyalgia is a condition characterized by widespread muscle pain and tenderness, but it does not typically involve the specific joint findings seen in this patient.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00178", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He has never felt like this before. Past medical history is insignificant. His blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg, pulse 86/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F). A T2-weighted MRI shows a left C5 hemicord lesion. The patient is treated with cervical immobilization, a course of steroids, and physical therapy. What other finding will most likely be seen in this patient? (A) Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion (B) Right-sided Horner's syndrome (C) Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement (D) Right-sided analgesia The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe answer is (A).\n\nThis patient is likely experiencing a spinal cord injury due to the chiropractic manipulation. The presence of a left C5 hemicord lesion on the MRI indicates that the spinal cord is partially damaged at this level. The symptoms of left-sided weakness are consistent with a lesion affecting the corticospinal tract, which descends through the spinal cord and controls motor function.\n\nGiven the location of the lesion at C5, the patient is likely to experience spastic paralysis at the level of the lesion, which means that the muscles below the level of the lesion (C5) will be affected and may exhibit spasticity (increased muscle tone) and weakness.\n\nThe other options are not as likely:\n\n(B) Right-sided Horner's syndrome is a sign of disruption of the sympathetic fibers that run through the spinal cord, which is not directly related to the C5 hemicord lesion.\n\n(C) Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement would imply that the lesion is affecting the corticospinal tract on the opposite side of the spinal cord, which is not the case here.\n\n(D) Right-sided analgesia would imply that the lesion is affecting the spinothalamic tract, which carries sensory information from the body to the brain. However, the lesion is located at C5, which is above the level of the spinothalamic tract for the lower body, and the patient's symptoms are limited to left-sided weakness.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00179", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He noticed it last month and felt that it has increased slightly in size. It is tender to touch but has no overlying skin changes. There is no breast discharge. The patient has cryptorchidism as an infant and underwent a successful orchiopexy. In addition, he was recently diagnosed with ADHD and is currently on methylphenidate with improvement in his symptoms. He has a family history of type I diabetes in his father and breast fibroadenoma in his mother. On exam, the patient is at the 82nd percentile for height, 79th percentile for weight, and 80th percentile for BMI. He has tanner IV pubic hair. Testicular volume is 7 mL on each side, and both testes are smooth and freely mobile.

This presentation is most consistent with glandular tissue enlargement, which is a common cause of breast masses in adolescent boys. \n\nKlinefelter syndrome (A) is a genetic disorder characterized by the presence of an extra X chromosome, resulting in 47,XXY karyotype. It is associated with small testes, low testosterone levels, and often breast tissue development. However, the patient in this scenario has normal testicular volume and is at Tanner stage IV, indicating normal pubertal development.\n\nLipomastia (pseudogynecomastia) (C) refers to the presence of fatty tissue under the nipple-areola complex, often seen in obese adolescent boys. While this patient is overweight, the mass is described as firm and discrete, which is more suggestive of glandular tissue enlargement rather than fatty tissue.\n\nTesticular cancer (D) is extremely rare in adolescent boys and would not typically present as a discrete, firm, and tender mass under the nipple. \n\nTherefore, the most likely etiology of this patient's condition is glandular tissue enlargement.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00183", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The correct answer is Ketamine. Ketamine works by blocking the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which can help reduce opioid tolerance and hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to pain). It is often used in combination with opioids to reduce the dose of opioids needed to manage pain. \n\nPropofol is a sedative-hypnotic agent used for anesthesia.

His mother says he has been increasingly irritable recently. His vocabulary consists of 50 words and he does not use sentences. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae and abdominal tenderness. He refers to himself by name but is unable to name body parts or count to three. Peripheral blood smear shows small, pale red blood cells with basophilic stippling. Which of the following processes is most likely impaired in this patient? (A) Conversion of ferrous iron to ferric iron (B) Conversion of porphobilinogen to hydroxymethylbilane (C) Conversion of aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen (D) Conversion of uroporphyrinogen III to coproporphyrinogen III The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D]\n\nExplanation: This patient is likely suffering from lead poisoning, which is suggested by the presence of small, pale red blood cells with basophilic stippling on the peripheral blood smear.

However, another possibility is clomiphene citrate, which is commonly used to induce ovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or other ovulatory disorders.\n\nIf clomiphene citrate were administered continuously rather than intermittently, it could also be used to treat conditions like endometriosis or fibrocystic breast disease. However, the closest option provided is PCOS.\n\nClomiphene citrate can be used to treat conditions that are sensitive to estrogen levels, and it works by blocking estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus, which leads to an increase in gonadotropin release.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00199", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He had recently lost his job and his house was about to begin foreclosure. His adult children were concerned for his well being and called the police requesting a welfare check. He was found unresponsive in his gurague. There were several empty bottles of vodka around him and one half empty container of antifreeze. A review of his medical records reveals that he was previously in good health. Upon arrival to the ED he regains consciousness.  His blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg, heart rate 120/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and temperature 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F). On physical exam his speech is slurred and he has difficulty following commands. His abdomen is diffusely tender to palpation with no rebound tenderness. Initial laboratory tests show an elevated serum creatinine (Cr) of 1.9 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 29 mg/dL.

The presence of antifreeze (ethylene glycol) in the patient's environment is a key clue. Ethylene glycol poisoning can cause AKI due to the formation of oxalate crystals in the renal tubules. The kidneys attempt to eliminate the toxin by converting it into oxalate, which then precipitates and causes renal damage. Therefore, the expected finding in this patient's urine would be urate crystals, but more specifically, calcium oxalate crystals are more commonly associated with ethylene glycol poisoning.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00201", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. He has worked as a fruit picker for the past 25 years. His current medications include captopril and metformin. Examination of the oral cavity shows a single ulcer near the vermillion border. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Squamous cell carcinoma (B) Aphthous stomatitis (C) Actinic keratosis (D) Traumatic ulcer The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[A] Squamous cell carcinoma\n\nReasoning: This patient's history of smoking and long-term exposure to UV radiation from working as a fruit picker increases his risk for squamous cell carcinoma. The fact that the lesion is painless and has been present for 3 months also suggests malignancy. Additionally, the location near the vermillion border, where the skin and mucosa meet, is a common site for squamous cell carcinoma. While actinic keratosis is also a possibility due to the patient's UV exposure, it typically presents as a small, rough patch rather than an ulcer. Aphthous stomatitis is a common condition, but it typically presents with multiple small ulcers and is painful. Traumatic ulcer is unlikely given the chronic nature of the lesion.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00210", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Endometrial cells obtained from study participants are plated on growth media and the distribution of cell cycle phase is measured with flow cytometry. Drug X, which is known to activate cyclin-dependent kinase 4, is administered to all the cells, and the distribution of cell cycle phase is measured again 1 hour later. Which of the following is most likely to result from the action of drug X on the Rb gene? (A) G1 phase arrest (B) Prophase I arrest (C) Initiation of S phase (D) Completion of G2 phase The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[A] G1 phase arrest \n\nThe Rb gene acts as a tumor suppressor by binding to and inhibiting the E2F transcription factor, which is necessary for the progression from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle. Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) phosphorylates and inactivates the Rb protein, allowing the cell to progress through the G1 phase. If drug X activates CDK4, it would lead to the phosphorylation and inactivation of the Rb protein, causing a release of the E2F transcription factor and resulting in the progression of cells from the G1 phase to the S phase. However, the question is asking what would happen 1 hour after drug X administration, not what happens as a result of drug X administration. Therefore, 1 hour after drug X administration, the distribution of cell cycle phase would likely reflect a shift from the G1 phase to the S phase. However, this is not an option. \n\nThe correct answer is not explicitly listed. However, based on the options, the most likely result 1 hour after drug X administration is that the cells would be arrested in the G1 phase because the drug would be continuously acting on the Rb gene, keeping the Rb protein phosphorylated and the E2F transcription factor active.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00211", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He also says he has been having intermittent fevers and severe night sweats which require a change of bed sheets the next day. His past medical history is significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosed 10 years ago with which he admits to not always being compliant with his antiretroviral medication. The patient reports a 20-pack-year smoking history but no alcohol or recreational drug use. A review of systems is significant for a 6 kg (13.2 lb) unintentional weight loss over the past 2 months. The vital signs include: temperature 37.8\u2103 (100.0\u2109) and blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, there are multiple non-tender swollen lymph nodes averaging 2 cm in diameter that is palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. Axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy is present on the right side. A cardiopulmonary exam is unremarkable. The spleen size is 16 cm on percussion. Laboratory studies show the following:\nHemoglobin 9 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 88 \u03bcm3\nLeukocyte count 18,000/mm3\nPlatelet count 130,000/mm3\n    Serum creatinine 1.1 mg/dL\nSerum lactate dehydrogenase 1,000 U/L\nAn excisional biopsy of a superficial axillary lymph node on the right is performed and a histopathologic analysis confirms the most likely diagnosis.

The elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and lymphadenopathy also support this diagnosis.\n\nThe excisional biopsy of a superficial axillary lymph node on the right confirmed the diagnosis of NHL. The next best step in the workup would be to further characterize the type of NHL, which is often done using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and molecular studies.\n\nThe TRAP test is used to diagnose hairy cell leukemia, a rare type of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. The presence of hairy cell leukemia is suggested by the patient's symptoms, such as weight loss, fever, night sweats, and splenomegaly, which are similar to those seen in NHL. However, the TRAP test is the most specific test for hairy cell leukemia, making it the next best step in the workup of this patient.\n\nAntinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is used to diagnose autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies are used to diagnose HCV infection.

For the past 2 days, he has developed a worsening headache, malaise, and pain in his hands and wrists. The patient has a past medical history of asthma managed with albuterol as needed. He is sexually active with both men and women, and he uses condoms \u201cmost of the time.\u201d On physical exam, the patient\u2019s temperature is 102.5\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 112/66 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

(A) Chikungunya (B) Dengue fever (C) Epstein-Barr virus (D) Hepatitis A The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B]\n\nRationale: \nThe patient's symptoms of fever, headache, malaise, and joint pain, along with the laboratory results showing leukopenia (low white blood cell count), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and elevated liver enzymes, are consistent with dengue fever. Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral illness common in tropical and subtropical regions, including Vietnam and Cambodia. The patient's recent travel history to these countries increases the likelihood of exposure to the dengue virus. The presence of a maculopapular rash and tenderness to palpation over the metacarpophalangeal joints further supports this diagnosis. Chikungunya is another mosquito-borne illness that can cause similar symptoms, but it typically presents with a more severe joint pain and a higher fever. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is more commonly associated with infectious mononucleosis, which typically presents with fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy. Hepatitis A is a viral hepatitis that typically presents with jaundice, fatigue, and abdominal pain, but it is not typically associated with fever, headache, and joint pain.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00229", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The malar rash, also known as a butterfly rash, is a classic symptom of SLE. The diffuse dry crackles heard on lung auscultation may indicate interstitial lung disease, which is a common manifestation of SLE. \n\nA skin biopsy is the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis, as it can show characteristic histopathological changes such as basal cell degeneration and a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate in the dermis, which are consistent with SLE. \n\nWhile a serum ANA titer can be positive in SLE, it is not specific to the disease and can be elevated in other autoimmune conditions as well.

His father died of lung cancer at the age of 54 years. His temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), the pulse rate is 82/min, the blood pressure is 118/80 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 18/min. Auscultation of his chest reveals the presence of localized rhonchi over the interscapular region. A plain radiograph of the chest shows a coin-like opacity in the right lung. Further diagnostic evaluation confirms the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma of the lung. If his blood were to be sent for laboratory evaluation, which of the following proteins is most likely to be elevated in his serum? (A) Bence-Jones protein (B) Calcitonin (C) CA 15-3 (D) Neuron-specific enolase The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] \n\nExplanation: Small cell carcinoma of the lung is a neuroendocrine tumor. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is a protein that is often elevated in patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung. NSE is a marker of neuroendocrine differentiation and can be used as a tumor marker for small cell carcinoma. \n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n- Bence-Jones protein is associated with multiple myeloma, not small cell carcinoma of the lung.\n- Calcitonin is associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma, not small cell carcinoma of the lung.\n- CA 15-3 is a marker for breast cancer, not small cell carcinoma of the lung.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00241", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He complains of pain in his legs and general weakness. On physical exam, he has full range of motion of his extremities but complains of pain. His blood pressure is 126/84 mm Hg and heart rate is 74/min. The decision is made to stop the statin and return to the clinic in 2 weeks to assess any changes in symptoms. After stopping the statin, his muscular symptoms resolve. What is the next best course of action to take regarding his LDL control?

This is a classic side effect of statins, particularly at high doses. \n\nTo maintain LDL control without exacerbating the patient's symptoms, a different statin should be initiated. The choice of statin should be based on the patient's risk factors for cardiovascular disease and the side effect profile of the new medication. \n\nRestarting rosuvastatin at a lower dose (A) may not be sufficient to prevent recurrence of symptoms. \n\nInitiating fenofibrate (B) or fish oils (D) may not adequately address the patient's LDL control, as these medications are not as potent as statins in lowering LDL levels.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00244", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

In a pilot study of 50 patients, the imaging test detected the presence of CMV retinitis in 50% of the patients. An ophthalmologist slit lamp examination, which was performed for each patient to serve as the gold standard for diagnosis, confirmed a diagnosis of CMV retinitis in 20 patients that were found to be positive through imaging, as well as 1 patient who tested negative with the device. If the prevalence of CMV retinitis in the population decreases due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, how will positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the diagnostic test be affected? (A) PPV decreases, NPV decreases (B) PPV decreases, NPV increases (C) PPV increases, NPV decreases (D) PPV unchanged, NPV unchanged The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[C] PPV increases, NPV decreases.\n\nExplanation: \n\nPositive Predictive Value (PPV) is the probability that a patient with a positive test result actually has the disease. It is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives.\n\nInitially, PPV = 20 (true positives) / (20 + 30 (false positives)) = 20/50 = 0.4 or 40%\n\nIf the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases, the number of true positives will decrease (let's say to 15), but the number of false positives will remain the same (30). \n\nNew PPV = 15 (true positives) / (15 + 30 (false positives)) = 15/45 = 0.333 or 33.3%\n\nSince the new PPV (33.3%) is higher than the initial PPV (40%), PPV increases.\n\nNegative Predictive Value (NPV) is the probability that a patient with a negative test result actually does not have the disease. It is calculated as the number of true negatives divided by the sum of true negatives and false negatives.\n\nInitially, NPV = 30 (true negatives) / (30 + 1 (false negatives)) = 30/31 = 0.968 or 96.8%\n\nIf the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases, the number of false negatives will increase (let's say to 10), and the number of true negatives will remain the same (30).\n\nNew NPV = 30 (true negatives) / (30 + 10 (false negatives)) = 30/40 = 0.75 or 75%\n\nSince the new NPV (75%) is lower than the initial NPV (96.8%), NPV decreases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is [C] PPV increases, NPV decreases.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00250", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Finasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor that can help reduce the size of the prostate by decreasing dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels. This can improve urinary flow and reduce symptoms. \n\nClonidine is used to treat hypertension and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but it is not typically used to treat BPH. Dihydrotestosterone is the actual hormone that is being targeted by finasteride, so it's not a treatment option.

He does not have any complaints. He says that he has tried to keep himself healthy and active by jogging and gardening since his retirement at age 50. He adds that he spends his mornings in the park and his afternoons in his garden. He has no significant medical history. The patient denies any smoking history and drinks alcohol occasionally. On physical examination, the following lesion is seen on his scalp (see image). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Psoriasis (B) Seborrheic keratosis (C) Actinic keratosis (D) Squamous cell carcinoma The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the description, [C] Actinic keratosis is the most likely diagnosis. \n\nActinic keratosis is a skin condition that is caused by prolonged exposure to the sun, often resulting in small, rough, scaly patches on sun-exposed areas of the body, such as the scalp. The patient's history of spending time outdoors, particularly in the mornings when the sun's rays are strongest, increases his risk for actinic keratosis. \n\nThe other options are less likely given the patient's history and presentation. Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune condition that can cause scaly patches on the skin, but it typically affects other areas of the body, such as the elbows, knees, and lower back. Seborrheic keratosis is a benign growth that can appear on sun-exposed areas, but it is usually more rounded and has a characteristic \"stuck-on\" appearance. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer, but it is less common than actinic keratosis and typically presents as a firm, red nodule or a flat, scaly patch.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00257", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She further expresses her concerns about the possibility of contracting tuberculosis as one of the patients under her care is being treated for tuberculosis. A PPD skin test is done and reads 11 mm on day 3. Chest X-ray demonstrates a cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe. The standard anti-tuberculosis medication regimen is started. At a follow-up appointment 3 months later the patient presents with fatigue. She has also been experiencing occasional dizziness, weakness, and numbness in her feet. Physical exam is positive for conjunctival pallor. Lab work is significant for a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume of 68 fl.

(A) Inhibition of ferrochelatase (B) Increased homocysteine degradation (C) Increased GABA production (D) Decreased ALA synthesis The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] \n\nThe patient's symptoms, including fatigue, dizziness, weakness, numbness in the feet, and conjunctival pallor, are suggestive of megaloblastic anemia. The laboratory findings of a low hemoglobin level (10 g/dL) and a low mean corpuscular volume (68 fl) are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nThe standard anti-tuberculosis medication regimen includes isoniazid, which can interfere with the synthesis of folic acid, leading to megaloblastic anemia. Isoniazid inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, but its primary effect is on the enzyme aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase, which is not the answer. However, Isoniazid also inhibits the enzyme ferrochelatase, which is involved in the production of heme, a critical component of hemoglobin. This inhibition leads to the accumulation of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and its oxidation product, biliverdin, and ultimately results in the production of porphyrins. This is known as aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) inhibition, but the more accurate answer is that it inhibits the enzyme ferrochelatase.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00259", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He has a history of major depressive disorder and had an ischemic stroke 4 months ago. Current medications are aspirin and sertraline. He is lethargic and disoriented. His pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 135/88 mm Hg. Physical examination shows moist oral mucosa, normal skin turgor, and no peripheral edema. While in the waiting room, he has a generalized, tonic-clonic seizure. Laboratory studies show a serum sodium of 119 mEq/L and an elevated serum antidiuretic hormone concentration.

The patient's serum sodium of 119 mEq/L indicates hyponatremia. The elevated serum antidiuretic hormone (ADH) concentration suggests the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), which is a common cause of hyponatremia in patients with major depressive disorder.\n\nIn SIADH, the serum osmolality is low due to the excess water reabsorption in the kidneys. The urine sodium is high because the kidneys are unable to concentrate the urine despite the high ADH levels. The serum aldosterone is normal because the problem is not related to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) \u2193 \u2191 \u2191.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00263", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

When she sees her neighbors walking their dogs outside, she is terrified and begins to feel short of breath. Recently, she has stopped picking up her children from the bus stop and no longer plays outside with her children in order to avoid seeing any dogs. Which of the following would be the best definitive treatment for this patient?

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of talk therapy that has been shown to be effective in treating specific phobias. CBT involves identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and behaviors associated with the phobia, and gradually exposing the patient to the feared object or situation in a controlled and safe manner.\n\nWhile selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be used to treat anxiety disorders, they are not a definitive treatment for specific phobias. Short-acting benzodiazepines may be used to provide temporary relief from anxiety symptoms, but they are not a long-term solution and can have negative side effects.\n\nSystematic desensitization is a type of behavioral therapy that involves gradually exposing the patient to the feared object or situation in a controlled and safe manner, but it is often used in conjunction with CBT, rather than as a standalone treatment.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00264", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The patient was found unconscious with a large metal spike protruding from his abdomen by a coworker who was unable to estimate the amount of time the patient went without medical aid. Upon arrival to the ER, the patient was unconscious and unresponsive. His vital signs are BP: 80/40, HR: 120 bpm, RR: 25 bpm, Temperature: 97.1 degrees, and SPO2: 99%.He is taken to the operating room to remove the foreign body and control the bleeding. Although both objectives were accomplished, the patient had an acute drop in his blood pressure during the surgery at which time ST elevations were noted in multiple leads. This resolved with adequate fluid resuscitation and numerous blood transfusions. The patient remained sedated after surgery and continued to have relatively stable vital signs until his third day in the intensive care unit, when he experiences an oxygen desaturation of 85% despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen at 15 breaths/minute. On auscultation air entry is present bilaterally with the presence of crackles. A 2/6 systolic murmur is heard. Readings from a Swan-Ganz catheter display the following: central venous pressure (CVP): 4 mmHg, right ventricular pressure (RVP) 20/5 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP): 20/5 mmHg. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP): 5 mm Hg. A chest x-ray is shown as Image A. The patient dies soon after this episode. What is the most likely direct cause of his death?

The patient had an acute drop in blood pressure and ST elevations during surgery, which was resolved with fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions, indicating a possible myocardial infarction. However, the most likely direct cause of his death is related to his respiratory symptoms.\n\nGiven the information, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) Diffuse alveolar damage\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms, such as oxygen desaturation, presence of crackles, and the chest x-ray findings, are consistent with ARDS. The Swan-Ganz catheter results, including the low CVP and PCWP, also support this diagnosis. The patient's death is likely due to the progression of ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.\n\nNote: The chest x-ray findings are not described, but based on the symptoms and test results, it is likely that the x-ray showed bilateral infiltrates or consolidation, which is consistent with ARDS.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00265", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He notes a pink bump that has rapidly developed on his forehead over the last month. In the past, he has had significant sun exposure including multiple blistering sunburns. The physical examination reveals a 2 cm dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug (as shown in the image). Excisional biopsy of the lesion reveals an exophytic nodule with central invagination, full of keratin. Keratinocyte atypia is minimal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Keratoacanthoma (B) Basal cell carcinoma (C) Seborrheic keratosis (D) Kaposi's sarcoma The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[A]\n\nExplanation: This patient's presentation is most consistent with a keratoacanthoma, a type of skin tumor that typically presents as a rapidly growing, dome-shaped nodule with a central keratin plug. The patient's history of significant sun exposure, including multiple blistering sunburns, increases his risk for skin cancer. However, the excisional biopsy results reveal minimal keratinocyte atypia, which is characteristic of keratoacanthoma. Basal cell carcinoma typically presents as a flat or slightly raised, translucent nodule with telangiectasias. Seborrheic keratosis is a benign skin lesion that often presents as a brown, black, or tan, flat or raised, rough patch. Kaposi's sarcoma is a type of skin cancer that typically presents as a purple, blue, or red lesion, often in immunocompromised patients.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00275", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

His breathlessness worsens while walking, climbing the stairs, and lying flat on his back. He also finds it difficult to sleep well at night, as he often wakes up to catch his breath. His pulse is 98/min and blood pressure is 114/90 mm Hg. On examination, he has mild respiratory distress, distended neck veins, and bilateral pitting edema is evident on the lower third of his legs. His respiratory rate is 33/min, SpO2 is 93% in room air, and coarse crepitations are heard over the lung bases. On auscultation, the P2 component of his second heart sound is heard loudest at the second left intercostal space, and an S3 gallop rhythm is heard at the apex.

This is consistent with the mechanism of action of loop diuretics, which work by inhibiting the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. This leads to a decrease in the reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and water, resulting in increased urine production and a decrease in blood volume.\n\nThe mechanism of action of loop diuretics is not directly related to the options provided.

(A) If 100 similar experiments were conducted, 5.2 of them would show similar results (B) There is a 5.2% chance that A is more effective than B is due to chance (C) There is a 94.8% chance that the difference observed reflects a real difference (D) This is a statistically significant result The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n(D) This is a statistically significant result.\n\nThe p-value of 0.052 indicates that if the null hypothesis (there is no significant difference between statin A and statin B) were true, there would be a 5.2% chance of observing a difference as large or larger than the one observed in this study. However, this does not mean that there is a 5.2% chance that statin A is more effective than statin B due to chance, as option (B) suggests. Instead, the p-value indicates that the observed difference is statistically significant, meaning that it is unlikely to be due to chance, and option (D) is the correct answer.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because it misinterprets the meaning of the p-value. The p-value does not predict the outcome of future experiments, but rather describes the probability of observing the current results assuming that the null hypothesis is true.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because it overstates the conclusion that can be drawn from the p-value. While a p-value of 0.052 does suggest that the observed difference may reflect a real difference, it does not provide a specific probability that the difference is real.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00291", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Past medical history is insignificant. Her temperature is 37.0 degrees C, blood pressure is 115/75 mm Hg, pulse is 76/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. The patient denies dyspnea, fatigue, and syncope. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a large, pedunculated tumor in the left atrium.

Myxomas are the most common primary cardiac tumors, and they are more common in women. The tumor can cause obstructive symptoms, such as dyspnea, fatigue, and syncope, due to its size and location. However, in this case, the patient denies these symptoms.\n\nThe most significant risk associated with a left atrial myxoma is the potential for embolic events, which can occur due to the tumor's friable nature and its tendency to shed fragments into the bloodstream. This can lead to sudden cardiac death or stroke. While the other options are possible, they are less likely in this scenario.\n\nAbrupt hypotension (A) might occur if the tumor causes significant obstruction of blood flow, but this is not the most likely risk.\n\nAcute arterial occlusion (C) is a possible complication, but it is less common than embolic events.\n\nSeptic embolism (D) is unlikely, as myxomas are typically benign tumors.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00293", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She was born at 39 weeks via spontaneous vaginal delivery, has met all developmental milestones and is fully vaccinated. Past medical history is significant for mild allergies to pet dander and ragweed, as well as a severe peanut allergy. She also has asthma. She normally carries both an emergency inhaler and EpiPen but forgot them today. Family history is noncontributory. The vital signs include: blood pressure 112/87 mm Hg, heart rate 111/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and temperature 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F). On physical examination, the patient has severe edema over her face and an audible stridor in both lungs. Of the following options, which is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?

The patient's history of a severe peanut allergy further supports this diagnosis. The patient's inability to access her EpiPen is a critical concern, as anaphylaxis can rapidly progress to a life-threatening condition. \n\nGiven this situation, administering IM epinephrine is the most appropriate next step in management, as it is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis and can help alleviate symptoms and prevent further complications. \n\nOral diphenhydramine (B) may not be effective quickly enough to address the acute symptoms of anaphylaxis. Topical diphenhydramine (C) would not be sufficient to treat anaphylaxis.

He states that he first noticed the lesion last year, but he believes that it has been slowly growing in size. Dermatopathology determines that the lesion contains neoplastic cells of melanocytic origin. Which of the following characteristics of the lesion would likely be found on physical examination? (A) Brown-black color in one area of the lesion to red-white in a different area (B) Macule that is 5mm in diameter (C) Well-circumscribed papule with smooth borders (D) Itching and pain to palpation The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe answer is C.\n\nThis is likely a melanoma, given the neoplastic cells of melanocytic origin. Melanomas often present as a well-circumscribed papule with smooth borders, which is characteristic of an expanding mass. This is in contrast to benign melanocytic lesions, which are often irregular in shape and have notched or ragged borders.\n\nOption A describes the \"ABCDE\" criteria for melanoma, which stands for Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter greater than 6mm, and Evolving size or shape. While this is a useful tool for identifying melanoma, it is not a characteristic that would be found on physical examination.\n\nOption B describes a macule, which is a flat lesion less than 5mm in diameter. While melanomas can present as macules, they often grow larger than 5mm.\n\nOption D describes itching and pain to palpation, which are not typical characteristics of melanomas. Melanomas are often asymptomatic, although they may cause itching or bleeding if they ulcerate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C, a well-circumscribed papule with smooth borders.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00297", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

(A) 64 (B) 16 (C) 8 (D) 4 The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe answer is [D].\n\nAccording to Poiseuille's law, resistance to blood flow in a vessel is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the vessel's radius (R^4). Since the occlusion has caused a 50% reduction in the diameter of the left circumflex artery, the radius of the vessel has been reduced by half. \n\nIf the original radius is R, then the new radius is 0.5R. \n\nThe resistance to blood flow in the vessel with the occlusion is proportional to (0.5R)^4 = 0.0625R^4. \n\nThe resistance to blood flow in a vessel with no occlusion is proportional to R^4. \n\nTherefore, the resistance to blood flow in the vessel with the occlusion is 0.0625R^4 / R^4 = 0.0625, which is 1/16 or 1/0.0625 = 16, but in terms of the factor increase, it's 16 divided by 1 which is 16, but that's the factor decrease. Therefore, the factor increase is 16 divided by 0.0625 which is 256 divided by 16 which is 16, but 16 is the factor decrease. Therefore the factor increase is 16 divided by 0.0625 which is 256 divided by 16 which is 16. But 16 is the factor decrease. Therefore the factor increase is 16 divided by 0.0625 which is 256 divided by 16 which is 16.

He has had similar episodes in the past when he also had to be rushed to the hospital. Physical examination shows body temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (98.9\u00b0F), pulse rate is 100/min, respiratory rate is 28/min and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Also, it shows decreased breath sounds on both sides, the peak expiratory flow rate is 200 L/min and SpO2 is 89% on room air. The man is given an initial treatment with nebulization using an inhaled short-acting \u03b2-agonist. An arterial blood gas analysis shows the following:\npH 7.48\nPaO2 59 mm Hg\nPaCO2 26 mm Hg\nHCO3- 26 mEq/L\nAfter administering oxygen by mask, the man\u2019s PaO2 increases to 75 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s condition?

However, the lack of wheezing or other signs of bronchospasm makes asthma less likely. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a high pH (alkalosis) with low PaCO2, indicating a respiratory alkalosis. This is consistent with hyperventilation, which is often seen in conditions such as panic attacks or anxiety, but in this context, it is more likely related to the patient's respiratory condition.\n\nThe patient's SpO2 was initially low at 89% on room air, but improved to 95% or more after administering oxygen by mask, indicating that the patient's primary issue is with oxygenation rather than ventilation. The patient's PaO2 was initially low at 59 mm Hg, but improved to 75 mm Hg after administering oxygen, indicating that the patient has a significant issue with oxygenation.\n\nThe patient's condition is most consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is characterized by non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, leading to hypoxemia and often bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including decreased breath sounds on both sides, low peak expiratory flow rate, and low PaO2, are consistent with ARDS. The lack of other signs such as wheezing, cough, or sputum production makes asthma and other respiratory conditions less likely.

The next morning on rounds, he complains of eleven episodes of diarrhea and near-constant flatulence overnight. His mental status has improved and his hand tremor has resolved. Which of the following medications did this patient most likely receive after admission? (A) Thiamine (B) Lactulose (C) Naloxone (D) Rifaximin The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n(D) \n\nThis patient's presentation is suggestive of Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is a medical emergency caused by thiamine deficiency. The physical exam findings of scleral icterus and a flapping tremor of the wrists (asterixis) are classic signs of this condition. The improvement in mental status and resolution of the hand tremor after treatment are also consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy.\n\nThe new symptoms of diarrhea and flatulence overnight are likely due to the treatment of Wernicke's encephalopathy with thiamine. Thiamine can cause gastrointestinal side effects, including diarrhea and abdominal cramps, especially when administered intravenously.\n\nTherefore, the patient most likely received thiamine after admission, which is the correct answer (A).<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00306", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He reports a 4-day history of steady right lower quadrant pain. He has had one small bowel movement in 4 days. Normally he has a bowel movement once a day. His medical history is notable for poorly controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He takes enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, and atorvastatin. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history and drinks 3-4 beers per day. His diet consists primarily of fast food. His temperature is 101.8\u00b0F (38.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 160/95 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 16/min. A review of the patient\u2019s medical record reveals colonoscopy results from 1 year ago. Relevant findings included multiple small, pedunculated polyps which were removed, multiple colonic mucosal outpouchings, and no other masses. This patient\u2019s condition is most strongly associated with which of the following disorders?

The presence of multiple small, pedunculated polyps and multiple colonic mucosal outpouchings suggests a possible diagnosis of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) or another polyposis syndrome. However, the specific association with his current symptoms of abdominal pain and constipation is more closely related to the development of a complication from these findings.\n\nConsidering the options provided:\n\n(A) Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that can lead to lung and liver disease, but it is not directly associated with the patient's symptoms.\n\n(B) Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disorder is a genetic disorder that leads to cysts in the kidneys and can cause kidney failure, but it is not directly associated with the patient's symptoms.\n\n(C) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of genetic disorders that affect the body's connective tissue, but it is not directly associated with the patient's symptoms.\n\n(D) Goodpasture syndrome is an autoimmune disease that can cause kidney and lung damage, but it is not directly associated with the patient's symptoms.\n\nHowever, considering the development of the complications from the previous colonoscopy findings, the most likely diagnosis is related to the development of a complication such as a diverticulitis or a complication from the polyps, which could be associated with the patient's condition.\n\nHowever, the best choice given the options is: (C)<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00307", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The patient\u2019s eldest daughter says that he couldn\u2019t move his arm during the episode. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and a hemorrhagic stroke 6 years ago, which was treated surgically. After admission, the patient gets increasingly worse and loses consciousness. A noncontrast CT of the head shows a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient is taken to the operating room, where the SAH evacuated, and the vessel is repaired. Postoperatively, the patient is unresponsive. Several days later, a repeat CT of the head shows an enlarging aneurysm in a different vessel in the brain. The patient\u2019s daughter is asked to consent to a non-emergent, life-saving operation since the patient is in a comatose state. She does not consent to the operation even though the physician stresses it would be life-saving. Upon further discussion, the physician finds out that the patient was abusive and neglectful to his children, and the daughter wants \u201cto live in peace.\u201d The patient has no written advanced directive. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action? (A) Follow the daughter\u2019s wishes to withhold the operation (B) Refer this case to the court (C) Contact another family member for consent (D) Report the daughter to the police The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[A] Follow the daughter\u2019s wishes to withhold the operation.\n\nIn this scenario, the patient has no written advanced directive, which means that the decision-making authority falls to the next of kin.

A photomicrograph of a biopsy specimen of the lesion is shown. Which of the following processes is most likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition? (A) Underexpression of COX-2 (B) Increased phosphorylation of serine and threonine (C) Impaired degradation of \u03b2-catenin (D) Abnormal transfer of phosphate to cellular proteins The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[C] \n\nThis patient's condition is most likely colorectal cancer, given the history of blood in the stool, pale conjunctivae indicating anemia, and a polypoid mass in the ascending colon on colonoscopy. The biopsy specimen likely shows adenocarcinoma.\n\nThe correct answer, [C], impaired degradation of \u03b2-catenin, is a key process involved in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. In this disease, mutations in the APC gene lead to the accumulation of \u03b2-catenin in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it activates the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. This pathway promotes the transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival, contributing to tumor development.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n\n- [A] Underexpression of COX-2 is associated with reduced risk of colorectal cancer, as COX-2 overexpression is a common feature of colorectal cancer.\n\n- [B] Increased phosphorylation of serine and threonine is a general feature of many signaling pathways, but it is not a specific process involved in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer.\n\n- [D] Abnormal transfer of phosphate to cellular proteins is a feature of several diseases, including diabetes and cancer, but it is not a specific process involved in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00312", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The paramedic upon arrival noted that the patient had left-sided facial droop. Her medical history includes asthma and sickle cell disease. She takes hydroxyurea, uses oxycodone as needed for pain, and an albuterol inhaler as needed for shortness of breath. The patient\u2019s temperature is 97\u00b0F (36.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 145/72 mmHg, pulse is 93/min, and respirations are 14/min with an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.

(A) Alteplase (B) Exchange transfusion (C) Hydralazine (D) Warfarin The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] Warfarin \n\nThis patient is presenting with symptoms of a stroke, specifically a left-sided facial droop and dysarthria, which are common signs of an ischemic stroke. The patient's medical history of sickle cell disease increases her risk of having a stroke due to the sickling of red blood cells, which can lead to vascular occlusion. The use of hydroxyurea is a common treatment for sickle cell disease to reduce the frequency of sickle cell crises and may also help reduce the risk of stroke. However, hydroxyurea does not directly treat a stroke once it occurs.\n\nThe best initial treatment for an ischemic stroke is thrombolysis with alteplase, but the patient's use of oxycodone may increase her risk of bleeding with alteplase, and there is no information about the time of onset of symptoms, which is typically required for alteplase administration. \n\nExchange transfusion is a treatment for sickle cell disease, particularly during a sickle cell crisis, but it is not typically used to treat an ischemic stroke.\n\nHydralazine is a medication used to treat hypertension, but the patient's blood pressure is within a relatively normal range.\n\nWarfarin is an anticoagulant medication that may be used to prevent future strokes in patients with sickle cell disease, especially those who have had a previous stroke. It is not typically used to treat an acute stroke, but it may be indicated in this patient given her history of sickle cell disease and the increased risk of future strokes.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00330", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The presence of a prominent A wave on the jugular venous pulse (correlating with atrial contraction) and a double apical impulse (due to a forceful contraction of the left ventricle) are classic findings in HCM. The S4 heart sound is also common in HCM due to the increased stiffness of the ventricle. There are no murmurs present, which is consistent with HCM as the murmur typically associated with HCM (a harsh systolic ejection murmur) is often not present due to the obstruction of blood flow being dynamic. \n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a condition characterized by the thickening of the heart muscle, which can lead to obstruction of blood flow and sudden cardiac death, especially in young athletes.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00336", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The patient states that he has not felt well for the past 24 hours and his symptoms are no longer tolerable. He denies taking any medications or illicit drugs and states he is generally healthy. His temperature is 99.3\u00b0F (37.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 122/88 mmHg, pulse is 107/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam demonstrates an ill appearing young man. Physical exam is notable for rhinorrhea, lacrimation, and piloerection. The patient\u2019s pupils are dilated and reactive to light. During placement of an ultrasound guided IV, multiple scars are noted in the antecubital fossa, and it is noted that it is very difficult to place an IV in this patient. During the exam, he begins actively vomiting. Which of the following could be an appropriate treatment for this patient\u2019s symptoms? (A) Clonidine (B) Diazepam taper (C) Haloperidol and diphenhydramine (D) Oseltamivir The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[C]\n\nExplanation: This patient is presenting with symptoms of a sympathomimetic toxidrome, including rhinorrhea, lacrimation, piloerection, dilated pupils, and tachycardia. The presence of multiple scars on the antecubital fossa and difficulty placing an IV suggest a history of intravenous drug use, which increases the likelihood of a substance-induced toxidrome. The most likely substance is a stimulant, such as cocaine or amphetamines. The patient's symptoms of severe diarrhea and vomiting are consistent with a stimulant-induced hyperthermia, which can be life-threatening. Treatment with haloperidol (an antipsychotic) and diphenhydramine (an antihistamine) can help to mitigate the sympathetic effects of the stimulant and reduce the risk of hyperthermia.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00339", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He reports that these symptoms seem to worsen with each fall. Initially, he could not remember directions to his home but now cannot remember recent conversations or appointments he has made. He often repeats questions that he asked shortly before. He has long-standing hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia. Current medications include aspirin, carvedilol, enalapril, and atorvastatin. Examination shows a bruise over the left temple and an unsteady gait. On mental status examination, he is oriented to place and person only. Short-term memory is impaired; he can recall 0 out of 5 objects after 10 minutes. Long-term memory is intact. He has no delusions or hallucinations. Muscle strength is decreased in the left lower extremity. The Babinski sign is present on the left. A CT scan of the head is shown.

The presence of a bruise over the left temple and an unsteady gait, along with decreased muscle strength and a positive Babinski sign, suggests a cerebrovascular component to the patient's condition.\n\nThe CT scan of the head is not described, but given the clinical presentation, it is likely that the patient has had a series of small strokes or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), leading to his progressive symptoms.\n\nThe most appropriate next step in management would be to address the patient's cerebrovascular risk factors and consider anticoagulation therapy to reduce the risk of further strokes.\n\n(A) Warfarin therapy is the most appropriate next step, as it can help reduce the risk of further strokes in patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease.\n\n(B) Vitamin E therapy may be beneficial in patients with Alzheimer's disease, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient, given the presence of cerebrovascular symptoms.\n\n(C) Tetrabenazine therapy is used to treat chorea associated with Huntington's disease, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.\n\n(D) Cognitive training may be beneficial in patients with mild cognitive impairment, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient, given the presence of cerebrovascular symptoms and the need to address the underlying cause of his progressive decline.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A).<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00341", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

A decision to perform an episiotomy is made to expedite vaginal delivery. The anesthesiologist locates the ischial spines by palpating the posterolateral vaginal sidewall and administers an anesthetic. Three minutes later, pinching the posterior vulva does not provoke pain. The anesthetized nerve most likely also supplies which of the following structures?

The patient's past history of similar episodes also supports this diagnosis. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for an allergic reaction is an antihistamine. Diphenhydramine (A) is a first-generation antihistamine that can cause drowsiness and is not the first choice for mild allergic reactions. Fexofenadine (B) is a second-generation antihistamine that is less likely to cause drowsiness and is a good choice for mild allergic reactions.

Her last period was 6 months ago. Since almost a year and a half ago, she intentionally restricted her diet at the expense of carbohydrates, exercised intensively, and lost 18.0 kg (39.7 lb). She had her menarche at the age of 12 and menstruated normally until last year. She is not sexually active. On physical examination, the vital signs include blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, heart rate 55/min, respiratory rate 12/min, and temperature 35.9\u00b0C (96.6\u00b0F). Her weight is 55.0 kg (121.3 lb), and her height is 166 cm (5 ft 5 in). Physical examination reveals the good development of muscles and decreased adiposity.

Intentional weight loss and restricted diet at the expense of carbohydrates.\n2. Significant weight loss (18.0 kg or 39.7 lb) over almost a year and a half.\n3. Absence of menstruation (amenorrhea) for 6 months.\n4. Good muscle development and decreased adiposity.\n5. Decreased calcium mineral deposits on bone scan.\n\nDecreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient because adipose tissue is the primary site of estrogen production in females. In anorexia nervosa, the reduced body fat leads to decreased estrogen production. This is the correct answer.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Insulin resistance is typically associated with obesity, not weight loss.\n\nC. Increased liver metabolism is not the primary cause of decreased estrogen concentration in anorexia nervosa.\n\nD.

She has had a lot of stress at work and has been on sick leave for 2 weeks, but states that she would like to return to work. She has had several episodes of lower abdominal pain. She says, \"\"I know I have cancer.\"\" She requests a diagnostic laparoscopy. She was diagnosed with peptic ulcer disease 6 months ago. Her only medication is omeprazole. The patient appears pale. Her temperature is 36.5\u00b0 C (97.7\u00b0 F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 90/65 mm Hg. On mental status examination she is tired and has a depressed mood.

However, the key findings are the patient's history of peptic ulcer disease, negative test for occult blood in the stool, and the presence of numerous crusts along the course of her left arm veins. \n\nThese symptoms, combined with the patient's statement \"I know I have cancer,\" suggest that she may be fabricating or exaggerating her symptoms. The patient's laboratory studies, including a low hemoglobin level and a high reticulocyte count, indicate anemia, but the negative test for occult blood in the stool and the abdominal ultrasonography findings make acute small bowel hemorrhage less likely. \n\nThe patient's symptoms are not explained by a medical condition, and her behavior is better explained by a psychiatric disorder. Factitious disorder, also known as Munchausen syndrome, is characterized by the intentional production or feigning of physical or psychological symptoms, primarily to gain attention and sympathy. This diagnosis fits the patient's presentation, as she has a history of fabricating symptoms and has requested a diagnostic laparoscopy despite the lack of medical evidence to support it. \n\nThe other options are not the best choices. Somatic symptom disorder is characterized by excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to somatic symptoms, but the patient's symptoms are not excessive or distressing. Conversion disorder is characterized by the presence of neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by a medical condition, but the patient's symptoms are not neurological in nature.

The patient's past medical history of polysubstance abuse and schizophrenia also plays a role in this presentation.\n\nThe most likely etiology of this patient's current presentation is (B) Cocaine. Cocaine is a central nervous system stimulant that can cause respiratory depression, which in turn leads to hypercapnia (elevated PaCO2) and respiratory acidosis. Additionally, cocaine use is often associated with violent behavior, which aligns with the patient's presentation of being found unconscious and covered in bruises outside a local bar.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n\n(A) Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that can cause respiratory depression, but it is more commonly associated with a mixed acid-base disorder.\n\n(C) Ethylene glycol is a toxic alcohol that can cause metabolic acidosis, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation.\n\n(D) Heroin is an opioid that can cause respiratory depression, but it is more commonly associated with a mixed acid-base disorder or a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00358", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The muscle biopsy findings of CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium are also characteristic of dermatomyositis. Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory myopathy characterized by skin rash and muscle weakness, often associated with CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the muscle.\n\nThe key features that point towards dermatomyositis in this case are:\n\n- Proximal muscle weakness\n- Absence of headaches or change in vision (ruling out other inflammatory myopathies like polymyositis)\n- CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium on muscle biopsy\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n\n- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can present with muscle weakness, but it is not typically associated with CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the muscle.\n- Polymyalgia rheumatica typically presents with pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders, and hips, rather than proximal muscle weakness.\n- Polymyositis can present with proximal muscle weakness, but it is typically associated with CD4+ lymphocyte infiltration in the muscle, rather than CD8+.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00360", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The patient is able to smile and furrow his brow normally, but she has noticed that he has a weak cry and suck. He was born at 38 weeks gestation via a spontaneous vaginal delivery without any complications. The mother said that the patient appeared \"normal\" until the past few weeks. On physical exam, his extraocular muscle movements are intact, and a symmetric smile is seen. He has symmetric flaccid weakness of both his upper and lower extremities. He also has a bell-shaped chest. Deep tendon reflexes are diminished. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?

The patient's weak cry, suck, and symmetric flaccid weakness of both upper and lower extremities, along with diminished deep tendon reflexes, are characteristic of this condition. The bell-shaped chest is also a common feature in congenital myasthenic syndrome.\n\nThe decreased acetylcholine receptor density is a key feature of congenital myasthenic syndrome, as it leads to impaired neuromuscular transmission and muscle weakness. \n\nThe other options are not consistent with this patient's presentation:\n\n(A) Anterior horn cell degeneration is seen in conditions such as spinal muscular atrophy, which typically presents with asymmetric weakness and wasting of muscles.\n\n(B) Axonal demyelination is seen in conditions such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, which typically presents with ascending weakness and areflexia.\n\n(D) Myonecrosis is seen in conditions such as rhabdomyolysis, which typically presents with muscle pain and weakness, but not symmetric flaccid weakness and diminished deep tendon reflexes.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00361", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He has been discontinuing heroin over the last month as part of his treatment plan. He is HIV positive, hepatitis B (HBV) positive, and was recently treated for an infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. He reports pain over his abdomen, knees, and shoulder.

(A) Methadone (B) Naloxone (C) Alvimopan (D) Loperamide The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] \n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as diarrhea and painful muscle cramps, are likely due to opioid withdrawal. However, the presence of HIV, HBV, and recent infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae suggests that the patient may also be experiencing pain due to an underlying condition such as osteomyelitis or septic arthritis, especially considering the pain over his abdomen, knees, and shoulder.\n\nLoperamide (D) is an antidiarrheal medication that can help manage the diarrhea associated with opioid withdrawal. However, it does not address the underlying pain or the potential infection.\n\nMethadone (A) and Naloxone (B) are both opioid medications, but they would not be the best choice for this patient as they do not address the diarrhea or the potential infection.\n\nAlvimopan (C) is a peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist that can help manage opioid-induced constipation, but it is not indicated for diarrhea and would not be the best choice for this patient.\n\nTherefore, the best therapy for this patient would be Loperamide to manage the diarrhea and potentially other opioid withdrawal symptoms, while further investigation is conducted to determine the cause of the pain and potential infection.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00365", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

A resident working under the physician plots a Darrow-Yannet diagram for the patient. The diagram is shown in the picture where the green dotted line represents the new fluid status. Which of the following is most likely to show increased secretion in this patient? (A) B-type natriuretic peptide (B) Bradykinin (C) Renin (D) Vasoactive intestinal peptide The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo solve this question, let's analyze the patient's condition and the Darrow-Yannet diagram.\n\nThe Darrow-Yannet diagram is a graphical representation of fluid status, where the x-axis represents the volume of extracellular fluid (ECF) and the y-axis represents the effective circulating volume (ECV). The diagram shows that the patient's new fluid status (green dotted line) is shifted to the left and upward, indicating a state of dehydration with increased ECF volume and decreased ECV.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting, it is likely that he is experiencing a loss of fluids and electrolytes. This would lead to a decrease in blood volume and effective circulating volume.\n\nIn this scenario, the body would likely increase secretion of substances that help to conserve fluid and electrolytes. \n\nOption (D) Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a hormone that stimulates the secretion of water and electrolytes in the intestines, which would help to conserve fluid and electrolytes. \n\nOptions (A) B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is increased in conditions of volume overload, (B) Bradykinin is a vasodilator that can increase blood flow and (C) Renin is involved in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which helps to regulate blood pressure and fluid balance.\n\nTherefore, the most likely substance to show increased secretion in this patient is Vasoactive intestinal peptide.\n\nThe answer is D.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00366", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She describes the pain as squeezing and tightness in her chest. This pain has been happening every few days for 3 months. She says there is no association of the pain with food or exercise. She is able to climb up to her fourth floor apartment daily without issue. Her only past medical history is migraines for which she takes appropriate medication. Here temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. She has no known family history. The patient is not in pain on presentation and EKG in the office is normal. 24-hour ECG monitoring shows transient ST elevations during the episodes of pain that resolve completely. The mechanism of this patient\u2019s chest pain is most similar to the mechanism behind which of the following? (A) Raynaud's phenomenon (B) Myocardial infarction (C) Aortic dissection (D) Costochondritis The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D]\n\nThe patient's symptoms of episodic chest pain described as squeezing and tightness, without association with food or exercise, and transient ST elevations on 24-hour ECG monitoring are characteristic of Prinzmetal's angina or variant angina. This condition is caused by transient coronary artery spasm, which leads to temporary myocardial ischemia.\n\nThe mechanism behind Prinzmetal's angina is similar to that of costochondritis, which is inflammation of the cartilage that connects the ribs to the breastbone (sternum). Like Prinzmetal's angina, costochondritis can cause sharp, stabbing chest pain, although the pain is usually localized to the affected costochondral junction.\n\nRaynaud's phenomenon is a condition that affects blood flow to the fingers and toes, causing them to turn white or blue in response to cold temperatures or stress. It is not directly related to the mechanism of Prinzmetal's angina.\n\nMyocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack, occurs when the blood flow to the heart is blocked, causing damage to the heart muscle. While myocardial infarction can cause chest pain, the mechanism is different from Prinzmetal's angina.\n\nAortic dissection is a serious condition where there is a tear in the inner layer of the aorta, causing blood to flow between the layers of the aorta.

His mother reports that he had trouble breathing soon after he started playing soccer with some friends and was unable to use his inhaler as it was empty. His family history is notable for emphysema in his paternal uncle and cirrhosis in his maternal grandfather. The child\u2019s temperature is 99.0\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, respirations are 28/min, and oxygen saturation is 91% on room air. Physical examination demonstrates wheezing bilaterally in all lung fields. The child is started on supplemental oxygen and a nebulized bronchodilator. Which of the following is a downstream effect of this medication? (A) Decreased leukotriene activity (B) Activation of muscarinic receptors (C) Decreased phosphodiesterase activity (D) Increased adenylate cyclase activity The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] Increased adenylate cyclase activity\n\nThe medication used in this scenario is likely a nebulized bronchodilator, such as albuterol. Albuterol is a beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist (\u03b22-AR agonist) that works by stimulating the \u03b22-adrenergic receptors in the lungs. This stimulation increases the activity of adenylate cyclase, an enzyme that converts ATP into cyclic AMP (cAMP). The increased cAMP levels then activate protein kinase A, leading to the relaxation of bronchial smooth muscles and bronchodilation.\n\nA] Decreased leukotriene activity is a mechanism of action of another type of asthma medication, such as montelukast, but not a direct effect of albuterol.\n\nB] Activation of muscarinic receptors is the mechanism of action of anticholinergic bronchodilators, such as ipratropium, but not a direct effect of albuterol.\n\nC] Decreased phosphodiesterase activity is a mechanism of action of phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as theophylline, but not a direct effect of albuterol.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00371", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

His symptoms started a few days ago and have been gradually worsening. Initially, the patient had a fever and a cough which has progressed to abdominal pain, diarrhea, and confusion. His temperature is 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 127/68 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air.

The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and confusion are consistent with this diagnosis. The localized crackles and decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung field are also consistent with pneumonia.\n\nThe urine antigen test for Legionella pneumophila is the best diagnostic test to guide current therapy in this patient. This test can detect the presence of Legionella antigens in the urine, which can help confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment with antibiotics such as azithromycin or levofloxacin.\n\nChest radiography (A) may show evidence of pneumonia but is not specific for Legionnaires' disease. Lung biopsy (B) is an invasive procedure that is not typically used to diagnose pneumonia. Sputum culture (C) may take several days to yield results and is not as sensitive as the urine antigen test for Legionella pneumophila.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00373", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The patient wears contact lenses, which increases the risk of microbial keratitis, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n2. The patient's symptoms include progressive pain and blurry vision, which are common presentations of microbial keratitis.\n3. The visual acuity in the affected eye is severely impaired, which is consistent with a severe ocular infection.\n4. The patient's occupation as a kindergarten teacher may increase the risk of exposure to ocular pathogens, but this is not the primary risk factor in this case.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n\nA. Angle-closure glaucoma typically presents with sudden severe pain, redness, and vision loss, but it often occurs in both eyes simultaneously.\n\nB. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis is a highly contagious viral infection that usually presents with conjunctival injection and discharge, but it is not typically associated with severe pain or vision loss.\n\nC.

His parents are both well and living in a senior living facility. He does not smoke and only drinks alcohol occasionally. During a review of symptoms, the patient described a hiking trip in and around the desert near Phoenix, Arizona, 4 months ago. At the office, his temperature is 38.6\u00b0C (101.4\u00b0F), heart rate is 102/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 120/82 mm Hg. A focused chest exam reveals mild fremetus and dullness with percussion on the right side. A chest X-ray shows a right-sided consolidation of the lower right lung, and a chest CT shows an irregular opacity measuring 3.8 cm x 3.0 cm in the sub-plural region of the right middle lobe, a small right-sided pleural effusion, and mild right-sided hilar adenopathy. A lung biopsy is performed to rule out cancer and reveals necrotic granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and spherules with endospores in the surrounding tissues. The laboratory tests show the following results:\nHemoglobin 12.9 mg/dL\nLeukocyte count 9,300/mm3\nPlatelet count 167,000/mm3\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate 43 mm/hr\nPeriodic acid-Schiff and silver methenamine Positive\nAcid-fast stain Negative\n Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

The patient's decreased blood pressure during inspiration (pulsus paradoxus) is also a key finding in cardiac tamponade.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Option A, dilation of the atria and ventricles, is more consistent with congestive heart failure, which is not indicated by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Option B, occlusion of a coronary artery, would typically present with chest pain and electrocardiogram changes, but the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest an acute myocardial infarction.

The improvement in symptoms with BIPAP and medical therapy further supports this diagnosis. The patient's lab values also suggest metabolic alkalosis, which is a common finding in heart failure due to the increased levels of aldosterone, leading to increased sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. The metabolic alkalosis is further exacerbated by the hypokalemia.\n\nRenal tubular acidosis type IV (RTA type IV) is the best explanation for the patient's current presentation. RTA type IV is characterized by hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypercalciuria. The hyperaldosteronism seen in heart failure leads to increased sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which is a hallmark of RTA type IV.

(A) It is stimulated by ATP (B) It is stimulated by citrate (C) It is inhibited by protein kinase A activity (D) It is inhibited by AMP The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] is incorrect because the correct answer is actually none of the options listed in the choices. The patient's condition is likely to be hereditary hemolytic anemia, specifically hereditary xerocytosis, or a similar condition, given the echinocytes on the peripheral smear and the family history of similar symptoms. However, the key point here is that the patient's condition is related to a disorder of red blood cell membrane stability, not a disorder of the biochemical pathways listed in the choices.\n\nHowever, given the choices, we can look for the closest answer related to the biochemical pathway affected in hereditary hemolytic anemia.\n\nThe correct answer is related to the biochemical pathway that is affected in hereditary hemolytic anemia, specifically the pentose phosphate pathway. The key enzyme in this pathway is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), which is the rate-limiting enzyme. This enzyme is inhibited by NADPH, which is the product of the reaction. However, NADPH is not listed in the choices. \n\nHowever, looking at the choices, none directly relate to the pentose phosphate pathway or G6PD. But the closest answer that relates to the biochemical pathway affected in hereditary hemolytic anemia is the pentose phosphate pathway's regulation, which is not listed.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00382", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

During this time, she has also had low energy and lost interest in playing the guitar. During high school, the patient went through similar episodes of low mood and poor sleep. At that time, she would repeatedly engage in binge eating and purging behavior, for which she was referred to therapy. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. The physician offers to prescribe a medication for her current symptoms. Treatment with which of the following drugs should most be avoided in this patient?

The integration of foreign DNA into the host genome is a common mechanism by which hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes HCC. HBV can integrate its DNA into the host genome, leading to the activation of oncogenes and the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, resulting in the development of HCC.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the pathogenesis of HCC in the context of HBV infection. Overexpression of secretory hepatitis antigen (A) is not a known mechanism for HCC development. Intracellular accumulation of misfolded protein (B) is more related to prion diseases or neurodegenerative disorders. Gain of function mutation of a proto-oncogene (C) can lead to cancer, but it is not the most likely underlying pathogenesis in this specific case of HBV-related HCC.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00386", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

His temperature is 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg and the pulse is 100/min. Past medical history is noncontributory and he takes no medication. His father and aunt both suffer from mild anemia. On examination, he is very pale and his spleen is enlarged. His hemoglobin is 5 g/dL and platelet count is slightly reduced. His peripheral blood smear is shown in the picture. Over the next 2 weeks, the patient recovers, and his hemoglobin is 11 g/dL.

(A) Autosomal dominant (B) X-linked recessive (C) X-linked dominant (D) Multifactorial The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the correct answer, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and family history.\n\nThe patient's symptoms include extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, and an enlarged spleen. His hemoglobin is low (5 g/dL), and his peripheral blood smear shows a specific pattern that is not mentioned in the question, but based on the symptoms and the recovery over 2 weeks, it is likely that the patient has a condition called autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), which is characterized by the immune system attacking and destroying red blood cells.\n\nGiven the family history of mild anemia in the patient's father and aunt, it is likely that the patient has a hereditary condition that predisposes him to AIHA.\n\nBased on the options provided, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) X-linked recessive\n\nThis is because AIHA can be associated with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), which is often caused by mutations in the FAS gene or other genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis. The FAS gene is located on the X chromosome, and mutations in this gene can cause ALPS, which is typically inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) X-linked recessive.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00398", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

A robust clinical trial is performed in a group of 100 subjects comparing the new screening test against the gold standard. The results are given in the table below:\nScreening test\\gold standard Disease present Disease absent\nPositive 45 15\nNegative 5 35\nWhich of the following is most correct regarding the statistical power of this new screening test? (A) Repeating the study would have no effect on the statistical power of the screening test. (B) The power of the test is 0.8. (C) If the specificity of this screening test were increased, the statistical power would increase. (D) If the sensitivity of this screening test were decreased, the statistical power would decrease. The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the statistical power of the new screening test, we first need to calculate its sensitivity and specificity.\n\nSensitivity (true positive rate) = True positives / (True positives + False negatives)\n= 45 / (45 + 5)\n= 45 / 50\n= 0.9\n\nSpecificity (true negative rate) = True negatives / (True negatives + False positives)\n= 35 / (35 + 15)\n= 35 / 50\n= 0.7\n\nThe power of a test is a function of its sensitivity, specificity, and the prevalence of the disease. However, the prevalence of the disease is not given in this table. Assuming a prevalence of 0.5 (50% of the population has the disease), we can estimate the power of the test.\n\nPower = Sensitivity * Prevalence\n= 0.9 * 0.5\n= 0.45\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer. To calculate the power of the test, we need to use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of true positives and false positives. \n\nUsing the binomial distribution, we can calculate the power of the test as follows:\n\nPower = P(45 or more true positives) + P(5 or fewer false negatives)\n= 0.8\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) The power of the test is 0.8.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00416", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She previously presented with itching, as well as frequent and painful urination. A vaginal swab was taken and sent to the laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. Diplococci were seen on Gram stain and were grown on Thayer-Martin agar. When discussing her infection, the patient says that she uses safe sex practices. Her history is significant for meningitis and for infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. The physician discusses that the reason behind these infections comes from a defect in the innate immune system. Which of the following best describes the component that is likely deficient in this patient? (A) Plays a role in angioedema (B) Degraded by C1 esterase inhibitor (C) Creates pores in the cell membrane (D) Induces the alternative complement pathway The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe answer is C.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of frequent and painful urination, as well as itching, are suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI) or a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as gonorrhea. The presence of diplococci on Gram stain and growth on Thayer-Martin agar confirm the diagnosis of gonorrhea (Neisseria gonorrhoeae).\n\nThe patient's history of meningitis and infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae suggests an underlying immune deficiency. Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae are both encapsulated bacteria that require the complement system to be effective in clearing them from the body.\n\nThe component that is likely deficient in this patient is the terminal complement component, C5b-9, also known as the membrane attack complex (MAC), which creates pores in the cell membrane, leading to bacterial lysis. However, the more likely answer is that this patient has a deficiency in the C5 component which is a necessary component for the formation of the MAC.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00417", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The patient's decreased ejection fraction (32%) and symptoms of orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and easy fatigability are consistent with HFrEF.\n\nThe correct answer is [D] Digoxin. Digoxin is a digitalis glycoside that is used to treat atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), not HFrEF. In fact, digoxin is contraindicated in patients with acute decompensated heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, as it can worsen symptoms and increase the risk of arrhythmias.\n\nThe other options are correct:\n\n* [A] Furosemide is a loop diuretic that is commonly used to treat edema and pulmonary congestion in patients with heart failure.\n* [B] Nesiritide is a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) analog that is used to treat acute decompensated heart failure.\n* [C] Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that is used to treat hypertension and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00422", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

This condition is characterized by the deposition of IgA immune complexes in various tissues, including the kidneys and intestines. The symptoms of abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and renal involvement (indicated by the elevated creatinine level and proteinuria) are consistent with HSP. The laboratory findings, including the elevated AST and ALT levels, could be due to the systemic nature of the disease, affecting multiple organ systems.\n\nConsidering the options:\n\n(A) Alcohol-induced liver injury is less likely, given the patient's blood alcohol level is.15 g/dL, which is not extremely high.\n\n(B) Immune response to streptococcal infection is not supported by the provided information.\n\n(C) Intestinal IgA deficiency is not the best explanation for the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, as the patient's IgA levels are not mentioned in the laboratory values.\n\n(D) Protein deposition is a possible explanation for the patient's renal involvement, but it does not fully account for the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms and the overall clinical presentation.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation for this patient's laboratory findings is likely related to Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (IgA vasculitis), but this option is not provided.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00424", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

(A) Cleave immunoglobulin (B) Inhibit phagocytosis (C) Inhibit ribosomal function (D) Trigger widespread inflammation The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D]\n\nThis patient's symptoms, particularly the black hemorrhagic eschars on his fingertips and the painful lymphadenopathy, are suggestive of a bite from a vector-borne pathogen, such as a tick or a mite, that transmitted a zoonotic infection. The presence of black eschars is a hallmark of infection with the bacterium Rickettsia, which is transmitted by ticks and other arthropods.\n\nRickettsiae produce a virulence factor called the outer membrane protein A (OmpA), which can trigger widespread inflammation by inducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, another key virulence factor is the outer membrane protein B (OmpB), also known as the OmpA-related protein, which is involved in the adhesion of the bacteria to host cells, and another key virulence factor is the stress response protein Rop, which is involved in the protection of the bacteria from the host's oxidative stress.\n\nHowever, the most well-known virulence factor of Rickettsia is the Rickettsial pathogenicity determinant (Rickettsia pathogenicity determinant), which is also known as the Rickettsial stress response protein, however the most known virulence factor is the factor that cleaves the host's complement component C3, and also the factor that cleaves the host's immunoglobulin is the factor known as the Rickettsial factor that cleaves the immunoglobulin, however the most known virulence factor of Rickettsia is the stress response protein Rop, and the Rickettsial pathogenicity determinant.\n\nHowever, among the given options the most accurate answer is (D) Trigger widespread inflammation, but it is not the most accurate answer, the most accurate answer is the factor that cleaves the immunoglobulin, however the most known virulence factor of Rickettsia is the Rickettsial stress response protein, and the Rickettsial pathogenicity determinant, however the answer that is more accurate among the options is (A) Cleave immunoglobulin, this answer is more accurate because the Rickettsial pathogenicity determinant cleaves the host's complement component C3, and also the Rickettsial factor that cleaves the immunoglobulin is the Rickettsial pathogenicity determinant.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00427", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

His past medical history is significant for hypertension and GERD. He takes lisinopril for hypertension and has failed multiple different therapies for his GERD. On physical exam, he is somewhat tender to palpation over his upper abdomen. Barium swallow demonstrates a subdiaphragmatic gastroesophageal junction, with herniation of the gastric fundus into the left hemithorax.

PEH is a type of hiatal hernia where the stomach herniates through the esophageal hiatus into the thoracic cavity, often resulting in complications such as incarceration, strangulation, or gastric volvulus. \n\nThe most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's underlying condition is surgical repair, specifically surgical gastropexy. This involves repairing the hiatal hernia and securing the stomach to the diaphragm to prevent further herniation and complications. \n\nLifestyle modifications (A) may help alleviate symptoms but do not address the underlying anatomical issue. Combined antacid therapy (B) and continuing on omeprazole (C) may help manage symptoms of GERD, but they do not address the paraesophageal hernia itself.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00430", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Several days prior, he had been swimming in the Gulf coast when he stepped on a sharp rock and cut his right foot. Three days ago, the patient presented to the emergency room after noticing painful redness spreading along his skin up from his right foot and was subsequently admitted for antibiotic treatment. Currently, his temperature is 101.8\u00b0F (38.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 84/46 mmHg with a mean arterial pressure of 59 mmHg, pulse is 104/min, and respirations are 14/min. His telemetry shows sinus tachycardia. His blood cultures are pending, but Gram stain demonstrated gram-negative bacilli. Which of the following best describes the form of shock and the skin exam? (A) Distributive shock with warm skin (B) Hypovolemic shock with warm skin (C) Neurogenic shock with cold skin (D) Obstructive shock with cold skin The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGiven the patient's presentation, including hemodynamic instability, tachycardia, and a history of a cut on the foot with spreading redness, it is likely that the patient has developed sepsis due to a bacterial infection, specifically a gram-negative bacillus, which is a common cause of sepsis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as fever (101.8\u00b0F or 38.8\u00b0C), tachycardia (104/min), and hypotension (blood pressure 84/46 mmHg with a mean arterial pressure of 59 mmHg), are consistent with distributive shock. Distributive shock is characterized by vasodilation and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance, leading to a drop in blood pressure.\n\nThe patient's skin exam is likely to show signs of infection, such as redness and warmth, rather than cold skin. This is because sepsis causes vasodilation, leading to increased blood flow to the affected area, which results in warm and red skin.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Distributive shock with warm skin.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00431", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She states that this has been one of many symptoms she has experienced lately. At times she has had trouble speaking and has noticed changes in her vision however these episodes occurred over a month ago and have resolved since then. Two days ago she experienced extreme pain in her face that was exacerbated with brushing her teeth and plucking out facial hairs. The patient has no relevant past medical history, however, the patient admits to being sexually abused by her boyfriend for the past year. Her current medications include ibuprofen for menstrual cramps. On physical exam it is noted that leftward gaze results in only the ipsilateral eye gazing leftward. The patient's initial workup is started in the emergency department. Her vital signs are within normal limits and you note a pale and frightened young lady awaiting further care.

The patient's symptoms could be related to a neurological condition such as a brain tumor or an aneurysm, but given the context of the patient's abuse, it's essential to address the potential for a traumatic cause of her symptoms.\n\nA thorough domestic abuse screening and exploring the patient's life stressors should be the initial step, as it may uncover underlying causes of her symptoms. This approach also prioritizes the patient's safety and well-being.\n\nThe other options are not the best initial tests for this patient's chief complaint:\n\nA) Head CT: While a head CT may be necessary later in the patient's evaluation, it is not the best initial test.\n\nB) Head MRI: Like the head CT, a head MRI may be necessary later in the patient's evaluation, but it is not the best initial test.\n\nC) Lumbar puncture: A lumbar puncture may be necessary to evaluate for conditions such as multiple sclerosis or Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, but it is not the best initial test in this scenario.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00432", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She also reported mild pelvic and abdominal pain. cervical motion tenderness was noted during the pelvic examination. The gynecologist also noticed a pink and inflamed nulliparous cervix with a preponderance of small red punctate spots. There was a frothy white discharge with a malodorous odor in the vaginal vault. A wet mount was prepared for a light microscopic examination, which revealed numerous squamous cells and motile organisms. The gynecologist concluded that this was a sexually-transmitted infection.

The patient denies having any history of asthma or respiratory symptoms, and does not smoke. His temperature is 99.8\u00b0F (37.7\u00b0C), pulse is 65/min, blood pressure is 126/86 mmHg, and respirations are 20/min. His oxygen saturation is 97%. On exam, he is pale and diaphoretic. His pupils are contracted. Diffuse wheezes are noted in all lung fields. What is the best treatment for his condition?

Organophosphate poisoning can occur through skin contact, inhalation, or ingestion of organophosphate pesticides. The contracted pupils are a key clinical finding in organophosphate poisoning, which is due to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, leading to an accumulation of acetylcholine in the nervous system.\n\nThe best treatment for organophosphate poisoning is atropine and pralidoxime. However, among the options given, the closest correct treatment is inhaled albuterol and oxygen, which can help alleviate the respiratory symptoms. The other options are not correct: Succinylcholine is a depolarizing muscle relaxant that can worsen the patient's condition, atropine and pralidoxime are the correct treatments for organophosphate poisoning but are not among the options, and inhaled ipratropium is an anticholinergic agent that can be used in asthma but is not the best choice for organophosphate poisoning.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00436", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

On further questioning, his wife has also noticed that he has seemed fatigued, with little interest in going on their usual afternoon walks. Medical history is notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both managed medically. He was last seen for follow-up of these conditions 1 month ago. Physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the cellular target of the medicine that is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms? (A) Angiotensin-II receptors in the membranes of vascular smooth muscle cells (B) Angiotensin-converting enzyme (C) Na+/Cl- cotransporter in the membranes of epithelial cells in the distal convoluted tubule (D) Na+/K+/2Cl- transporters in the membranes of epithelial cells in the ascending loop of Henle The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe patient's symptoms of constipation, fatigue, and decreased interest in physical activities are suggestive of hypothyroidism, which is often a side effect of certain medications, such as lithium or amiodarone, but not the ones listed. However, the most likely cause of these symptoms is related to the patient's medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both of which are managed medically. \n\nThe medications for hypertension and hyperlipidemia most commonly associated with the described symptoms are thiazide diuretics. Thiazide diuretics act by inhibiting the Na+/Cl- cotransporter in the membranes of epithelial cells in the distal convoluted tubule, leading to increased sodium and water excretion. However, they can also cause hypokalemia, which can lead to constipation. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of fatigue and decreased interest in physical activities are suggestive of hypothyroidism, which can be caused by thiazide diuretics by decreasing the release of thyroid hormones.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: \n\n[C] Na+/Cl- cotransporter in the membranes of epithelial cells in the distal convoluted tubule.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00439", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The patient states that his symptoms started about a week ago and have steadily worsened. He describes the abdominal pain as mild to moderate, dull, and deeply localized to the umbilical region. Past medical history is significant for 2 transient ischemic attacks 6 months prior, characterized by a sudden right-sided weakness and trouble speaking but recovered fully within 30 minutes. Current medications are sildenafil 100 mg orally as needed. Patient reports a 30-pack-year smoking history and heavy alcohol use on the weekends. Review of systems is significant for decreased appetite and feeling easily full. Vitals are temperature 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure 155/89 mm Hg, pulse 89/min, respirations 16/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The cardiac exam is normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Carotid bruit present on the right. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Bowel sounds present. A pulsatile abdominal mass is felt in the lower umbilical region. Patient\u2019s feet have the following appearance seen in the picture. Abdominal ultrasound reveals the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Contrast CT reveals a small, unruptured AAA (diameter 4.1 cm). High flow supplemental oxygen and fluid resuscitation are initiated. Morphine sulfate and metoprolol are administered. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient?\n  (A) Discharge with clinical surveillance and ultrasound every 6 months (B) Elective endovascular repair (C) Elective open surgical repair (D) Emergency open surgical repair The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B]\n\nRationale: The patient has a small, unruptured AAA with a diameter of 4.1 cm. The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend elective repair for aneurysms with a diameter of 5.5 cm or larger, but for aneurysms with a diameter of 4.0-5.4 cm, the decision to repair is based on the patient's overall health status and surgical risk. Given the patient's history of transient ischemic attacks, smoking history, and the presence of a carotid bruit, he is at high risk for cardiovascular events. However, the aneurysm is not yet large enough to warrant immediate repair, and the patient is not in shock or showing signs of impending rupture. Therefore, elective endovascular repair is the best course of treatment for this patient.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00449", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

It works by inhibiting the enzyme phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3), which breaks down cyclic AMP (cAMP) in platelets and smooth muscle cells. By inhibiting PDE3, cilostazol increases the levels of cAMP, leading to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and reduced platelet aggregation. This improves blood flow to the muscles and alleviates symptoms of intermittent claudication.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00452", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She has been breastfeeding the infant but feels the latch has been poor and is unsure how much milk he has been consuming but feels it is not enough. A lactation consult was called for the patient and it was noted that despite proper instruction the observed latch was still poor. When asked the mother stated that the baby is currently making stools 2 times per day. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of the patient's presentation? (A) Breast milk jaundice (B) Breastfeeding jaundice (C) Sepsis (D) Physiologic hyperbilirubinemia The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D]\n\nReasoning: \n\nThis question involves a 3-day-old full-term infant presenting with jaundice, which is a common condition in newborns. The infant is breastfeeding, but the latch is poor, and the mother is unsure about the infant's milk intake. However, the infant is producing stools 2 times per day, which suggests that the infant is likely getting enough milk.\n\nThe key points to consider are:\n\n1. The infant is full-term and 3 days old, which is within the typical age range for physiologic hyperbilirubinemia (also known as breast milk jaundice).\n2. The infant is breastfeeding, but the latch is poor, which might suggest that the infant is not getting enough milk. However, the production of 2 stools per day suggests that the infant is likely getting enough milk.\n3. The infant's overall condition is good, with normal sleep patterns and no signs of distress or infection.\n\nBased on these points, the most likely etiology of the patient's presentation is physiologic hyperbilirubinemia, which is a common condition in newborns that is caused by the breakdown of red blood cells and the processing of bilirubin by the liver. It is not related to the quality of the latch or the amount of milk consumed.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n\nA) Breast milk jaundice typically presents in the second week of life, not at 3 days old.\n\nB) Breastfeeding jaundice is caused by dehydration and inadequate milk intake, but the production of 2 stools per day suggests that the infant is likely getting enough milk.\n\nC) Sepsis would typically present with more severe symptoms, such as fever, lethargy, and poor feeding, which are not mentioned in this case.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00457", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

There is no history of fever. His regular medications include inhaled salmeterol and inhaled fluticasone propionate. He was a chronic smoker but quit smoking 2 years ago. His temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F), the pulse rate is 88/min, the blood pressure is 128/86 mm Hg, and the respirations are 30/min. On physical examination, the use of the accessory muscles of respiration is evident and the arterial saturation of oxygen is 87%. Auscultation of the chest reveals the presence of bilateral rhonchi with diminished breath sounds in both lungs. Which of the following medications, if administered for the next 2 weeks, is most likely to reduce the risk of subsequent exacerbations over the next 6 months? (A) Oral prednisone (B) Supplemental oxygen (C) Montelukast (D) Nebulized N-acetylcysteine The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D]\n\nExplanation: The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The use of oral corticosteroids, such as prednisone, is a standard treatment for acute exacerbations of COPD. However, the question asks about reducing the risk of subsequent exacerbations over the next 6 months. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are a key component of long-term management of COPD to reduce the frequency of exacerbations.\n\nAmong the options provided, nebulized N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been shown to reduce the frequency of exacerbations in patients with COPD when used as an adjunct to standard therapy. A 2014 Cochrane review found that NAC reduced the rate of exacerbations by 20% compared to placebo over a period of 6 months.\n\nWhile supplemental oxygen may be necessary for patients with severe hypoxemia, it does not reduce the risk of subsequent exacerbations. Oral prednisone and montelukast may provide some benefits in the short term, but they are not as effective as ICS in reducing the risk of exacerbations over the long term.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00464", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The patient has been trying to get pregnant and was successful recently, but now she is experiencing abdominal pain, contractions, and a bloody vaginal discharge. According to her last appointment with her primary care provider, she is 10 weeks pregnant. The patient has a past medical history of constipation, anxiety, and substance abuse. She is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a bloody vaginal discharge and an open cervix. The patient is initially extremely grateful for the care she is receiving and thanks the doctor and the nursing staff for saving her baby. Upon hearing the news that she is having a spontaneous abortion, the patient becomes angry and aggressive and states that her physician and the medical staff are incompetent, evil, and she is going to sue all of them. The patient is left to grieve but upon entering the room again you notice that the patient has new lacerations over her wrists and that some of the medical equipment in the room is broken. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Antisocial personality disorder (B) Borderline personality disorder (C) Normal grief response (D) Post-traumatic stress disorder The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B] \n\nExplanation: The patient's reaction to the diagnosis of a spontaneous abortion is a classic presentation of a borderline personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder is characterized by intense emotional dysregulation, unstable relationships, and impulsivity. The patient's shift from gratitude to anger and aggression in response to the news of the spontaneous abortion is a hallmark of this disorder. Additionally, the patient's self-inflicted lacerations and the destruction of medical equipment in the room suggest a pattern of impulsive and self-destructive behavior, which is also consistent with borderline personality disorder. Antisocial personality disorder involves a disregard for others' rights, impulsivity, and aggression, but it does not typically involve the same level of emotional dysregulation or self-destructive behavior as seen in borderline personality disorder. Normal grief response would involve a range of emotions, including sadness, anger, and possibly guilt, but it would not typically involve self-inflicted harm or destruction of property. Post-traumatic stress disorder involves symptoms of anxiety and avoidance that occur in response to a traumatic event, but it would not typically involve the same level of emotional dysregulation or impulsive behavior as seen in borderline personality disorder.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00465", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The pain developed over time and now limits his mobility. He states that the pain is worse at the end of the day, though he does have some early-morning stiffness lasting about 20 minutes. He used to have some success with over-the-counter NSAIDs; however, they no longer help. The patient also has been taking metformin for the past 2 years and is severely obese, with a BMI of 41 kg/m2. Additionally, he states that he has felt increasingly tired during the day, often dozes off during work, and no longer feels refreshed when he wakes up in the morning. Upon examination, there is no tenderness on palpation or erythema; however, some crepitus is felt. He has no other complaints but has a family history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on his mother\u2019s side. Which of the following factors is the underlying cause of the patient\u2019s pain, as well as the rest of his complaints? (A) Medication side effect (B) Excess weight (C) Infection (D) Occult malignancy The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B]\n\nRationale: The patient's symptoms of increased bilateral knee pain, early-morning stiffness, and crepitus are suggestive of osteoarthritis (OA). The worsening of symptoms over time, lack of tenderness or erythema on examination, and family history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on the mother's side are also consistent with OA. The patient's obesity (BMI of 41 kg/m2) is a significant risk factor for OA, as excess weight increases the stress on weight-bearing joints, leading to cartilage degeneration and joint pain. The patient's symptoms of daytime fatigue and excessive daytime sleepiness are also consistent with sleep apnea, which is a common comorbidity in obese individuals. The patient's obesity and sleep apnea are likely contributing to his overall symptoms and complaints.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00467", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

His condition started suddenly 30 minutes ago. He has had hypertension for the past 10 years for which he takes bisoprolol. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.7\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, and the pulse is 100/min and irregular. On physical examination, the patient appears in severe pain and his left leg is pale and cool. The popliteal pulse is weaker on the left side compared to the right side. Which of the following is the most common cause of this patient's condition? (A) Vasculitis (B) Hyperhomocysteinemia (C) Arterial emboli (D) Arterial trauma The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[C]\n\nExplanation: The patient's presentation of sudden onset of severe left leg pain and tingling, along with a weaker popliteal pulse on the left side, suggests an acute limb ischemia. The irregular pulse and history of hypertension are suggestive of atrial fibrillation, which is a common source of arterial emboli. The most common cause of acute limb ischemia in patients with atrial fibrillation is arterial emboli, which can originate from the heart and travel to the lower extremities, causing sudden limb ischemia.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00480", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He is concerned that she has not undergone puberty yet, while all of her classmates at school have. The patient herself feels well overall, with no specific complaints. Examination shows vital signs of T 98.9, HR 71, and BP 137/92. The physician notes undeveloped breasts and normal external and internal female genitalia in Tanner I stage of development. Her body mass index is within normal limits, she is in the 40th percentile for height, and she is agreeable and pleasant during the interview. Which of the following additional findings is likely present in this patient? (A) Aromatase enzyme deficiency (B) Hypokalemia (C) XY karyotype (D) Hypercortisolism The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe answer is (A). \n\nThis patient's presentation of primary amenorrhea and undeveloped breasts in Tanner I stage of development, with a normal external and internal female genitalia, is suggestive of a condition known as aromatase deficiency. Aromatase is an enzyme responsible for converting androgens to estrogens. In aromatase deficiency, there is a decreased conversion of androgens to estrogens, resulting in low estrogen levels and delayed or absent puberty. This condition is usually associated with elevated levels of androgens and can be diagnosed through measurement of urinary androgen metabolites or direct measurement of aromatase activity.\n\nThe other options are not likely:\n\n- (B) Hypokalemia is not typically associated with delayed puberty.\n- (C) XY karyotype would suggest a condition such as androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), where there is a failure of the body to respond to androgens, resulting in a female phenotype despite the presence of XY chromosomes. However, this patient has normal external and internal female genitalia, making AIS less likely.\n- (D) Hypercortisolism (Cushing's syndrome) is a condition caused by excess cortisol production, which can lead to a variety of symptoms including weight gain, hypertension, and delayed puberty. However, this patient's normal body mass index and height percentile make this option less likely.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00481", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He has a history of cirrhosis of the liver secondary to alcoholism. He started becoming more confused a few days ago and it has been getting gradually worse. His temperature is 98.8\u00b0F (37.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 134/90 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals a distended abdomen that is non-tender. Neurological exam is notable for a confused patient and asterixis. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 139 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nK+: 3.3 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 22 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 59 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.1 mg/dL\nCa2+: 10.2 mg/dL\n\nWhich of the following is the best next treatment for this patient? (A) Dextrose (B) Lactulose (C) Potassium (D) Rifaximin The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B]\n\nRationale: This patient is likely suffering from hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of cirrhosis of the liver. The key findings in this patient include confusion, asterixis, and a distended non-tender abdomen. The laboratory values show a normal glucose level and a slightly elevated creatinine level, which does not suggest a need for dextrose. The patient's potassium level is low, but the primary issue is not hypokalemia. Lactulose is a first-line treatment for hepatic encephalopathy, as it helps to reduce ammonia levels in the blood by promoting its excretion in the stool. Rifaximin is an antibiotic that can be used as an adjunctive treatment for hepatic encephalopathy, but it is not the best next step in this case.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00484", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He informs the physician that he is asthmatic, but does not use inhalers regularly because he does not like using medications. He is a non-smoker and occasionally drinks alcohol. On physical examination, the temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), the pulse is 120/min, the blood pressure is 114/76 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 32/min. Auscultation of the chest reveals bilateral wheezing. The physician asks the nurse to administer nebulized albuterol; however, the boy declines nebulized albuterol because of a history of palpitations that he experienced previously. The physician then prescribes nebulized ipratropium bromide, which results in significant clinical improvement.

The activation of muscarinic receptors leads to the release of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) through the phosphoinositol system, which ultimately causes bronchoconstriction. By blocking these receptors, ipratropium bromide prevents the release of IP3 and DAG, leading to bronchodilation and improved symptoms in the patient.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00494", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The mother had no prenatal care. Examination of the smaller newborn shows a flattened nose and left-sided clubfoot. The hematocrit is 42% for the smaller newborn and 71% for the larger newborn. This pregnancy was most likely which of the following? (A) Monochorionic-diamniotic monozygotic (B) Dichorionic-diamniotic dizygotic (C) Monochorionic-monoamniotic monozygotic (D) Conjoined twins The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B] \n\nThe key to this question is the difference in hematocrit levels between the two newborns. The hematocrit is a measure of the proportion of blood volume that is made up of red blood cells. In a monochorionic (shared placenta) pregnancy, the fetuses share the same blood supply, which can lead to a transfer of blood between the fetuses. This can result in polycythemia (increased red blood cell mass) in one fetus and anemia (decreased red blood cell mass) in the other. \n\nIn this case, the smaller newborn has a hematocrit of 42%, which is lower than normal, and the larger newborn has a hematocrit of 71%, which is higher than normal. This suggests that the fetuses are sharing a placenta and that there has been a transfer of blood from the larger fetus to the smaller fetus.

She has also had progressive recurring headaches and visual impairment over the last month. Three days ago, she had a seizure but has not seen a physician. She is oriented only to person. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.1\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg. Capillary refill time is more than 3 seconds.

This suggests that the kidneys are unable to concentrate the urine properly, which is a sign of ADH deficiency.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as agitation, confusion, lethargy, progressive recurring headaches, and visual impairment, are consistent with severe hypernatremia.\n\nThe other options are not the most likely explanation for this patient's hypernatremia:\n\nA. Increased water intake would actually help to lower the sodium level, not increase it.\n\nB. Increased adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) secretion can cause hypernatremia, but it is not the most likely explanation in this case.\n\nD. Decreased adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) secretion is not directly related to hypernatremia.\n\nThe presence of seizures, lethargy, and confusion suggests that this patient's hypernatremia is severe and may be life-threatening.

She has had multiple episodes of upper abdominal pain over the past year. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. Physical examination shows a distended abdomen with diffuse tenderness and high-pitched bowel sounds. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a dilated bowel, multiple air-fluid levels, and branching radiolucencies in the right infra-diaphragmatic region. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?

The branching radiolucencies in the right infra-diaphragmatic region on the x-ray are suggestive of metastatic disease from a malignancy in the right upper quadrant, likely from a gallbladder carcinoma or a liver tumor. The dilated bowel, multiple air-fluid levels, and high-pitched bowel sounds are consistent with a mechanical obstruction of the small intestine. \n\nOption A, perforation of the duodenal wall, would typically present with severe abdominal pain and free air under the diaphragm on an x-ray, which is not described in this case.

The patient\u2019s son says he has difficulty remembering recent events and names. He says the patient\u2019s symptoms have progressively worsened over the last several years but became acutely worse just recently. Also, yesterday, the patient complained that he could not see out of his right eye, but today he can. When asked about these concerns, the patient seems to have no insight into the problem and reports feeling well. His medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension. He had a left basal ganglia hemorrhage 12 years ago and a right middle cerebral artery infarction 4 years ago. Current medications are amlodipine, aspirin, clopidogrel, metformin, sitagliptin, and valsartan. He lives with his son and can feed himself and change his clothes. There is no history of urinary or fecal incontinence. His vitals include: blood pressure 137/82 mm Hg, pulse 78/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented. He is unable to perform simple arithmetic calculations and the mini-mental status exam is inconclusive. He can write his name and comprehend written instructions. Muscle strength is 4/5 on the right side. The tone is also slightly reduced on the right side with exaggerated reflexes. His gait is hemiparetic. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

He has a history of two previous strokes (left basal ganglia hemorrhage and right middle cerebral artery infarction), which are risk factors for vascular dementia. His symptoms of memory loss, difficulty with calculations, and hemiparesis on the right side are also consistent with vascular dementia. Additionally, his recent exacerbation of symptoms could be due to a new vascular event. The lack of insight into his problems is also consistent with vascular dementia. \n\nAlzheimer's disease is less likely because it typically presents with a more gradual decline in memory and cognitive function without the presence of previous strokes. \n\nLewy body dementia is also less likely because it typically presents with fluctuations in cognitive function, visual hallucinations, and Parkinsonian motor symptoms, which are not present in this patient.\n\nNormal-pressure hydrocephalus is less likely because it typically presents with the triad of gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and dementia, which is not present in this patient.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00510", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

In fact, the American Thyroid Association recommends continuing methimazole in pregnant women with hyperthyroidism, unless there are specific contraindications or side effects. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is an alternative medication that can be used during the first trimester of pregnancy, but it has a higher risk of liver toxicity compared to methimazole. Glucocorticoids are not typically used to treat hyperthyroidism, and radioiodine therapy is contraindicated in pregnancy due to the risk of fetal thyroid ablation.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00513", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

His temperature is 37.3\u00b0C (99.1\u00b0F), pulse is 116/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 79/42 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Examination shows multiple abrasions over the arms and thorax. There is a 1-cm (0.4-in) entry wound with minimal bleeding on the right side of the chest in the 6th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Abdominal examination shows diffuse mild tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. A focused assessment with sonography shows no obvious free fluid in the pericardium; assessment of the abdomen is equivocal. An x-ray of the chest shows mild opacification of the right lower lobe.

Which of the following is expected in individuals with an ATP2A1 gene mutation? (A) Muscle relaxation time: decreased, cytosolic calcium concentration: increased (B) Muscle relaxation time: increased, cytosolic calcium concentration: increased (C) Muscle relaxation time: increased, cytosolic calcium concentration: no change (D) Muscle relaxation time: no change, cytosolic calcium concentration: decreased The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] Muscle relaxation time: no change, cytosolic calcium concentration: decreased.\n\nThe ATP2A1 gene encodes for the SERCA1 calcium ATPase pump, which is responsible for pumping calcium ions back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum during muscle relaxation. With a loss-of-function mutation in the ATP2A1 gene, the pump would not be able to remove calcium ions from the cytosol efficiently, leading to an accumulation of cytosolic calcium. However, this does not directly affect muscle relaxation time, which is influenced by the rate of calcium removal from the cytosol rather than the absolute concentration of cytosolic calcium.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00521", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

PCD is a rare genetic disorder characterized by defective ciliary function, leading to respiratory and sinus infections, infertility, and situs inversus. \n\nThe patient's difficulty breathing, bluish discoloration of the lips, and crackles over both lung fields suggest respiratory involvement. The enlargement of the tonsils and cervical lymph nodes may be due to recurrent infections. \n\nMethenamine silver staining of bronchial lavage fluid showing disc-shaped cysts is consistent with the presence of cystic bronchiectasis, a hallmark of PCD. \n\nDecreased serum IgA, IgE, and IgG titers are not specific to PCD but may be seen in patients with chronic infections and malnutrition. \n\nPrimary ciliary dyskinesia is caused by mutations in genes that encode for proteins involved in the assembly of ciliary microtubules and axonemes, which are crucial for ciliary motility. \n\nActin filament assembly (A) is not directly related to ciliary function. T-cell receptor signaling (B) is involved in immune function but not in ciliary motility. Microtubule polymerization (C) is related to ciliary structure but is not the most specific defect in PCD. \n\nThe correct answer is D) B-cell maturation is not directly involved in the disease.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with DKA, including hyperglycemia (finger stick glucose 630 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH 7.1, HCO3 8 mEq/L), and the presence of ketones in the urine.\n\nThe initial step in managing DKA is to correct dehydration with IV fluids, which is already being done with the bolus of 0.9% NaCl. The next step is to administer IV insulin to help lower blood glucose levels and reduce ketone production. Insulin also has a role in reducing the metabolic effects of glucagon and stimulating the uptake of glucose by cells.\n\nThe other options are not the next best step:\n\nA. Infusing NaHCO3 slowly may be considered in severe cases of metabolic acidosis, but it is not the next step in the management of DKA.\n\nB. Switching fluids to 0.45% NaCl may be necessary if the patient becomes over-hydrated or if there is evidence of volume overload, but it is not the next step in the management of DKA.\n\nD. Replacing potassium intravenously is important in the management of DKA, as patients often develop hypokalemia due to insulin deficiency and the loss of potassium in the urine. However, this is not the next step, as the patient's potassium level is only slightly low (3.1 mEq/L) at this point, and the initial priority is to correct dehydration and lower blood glucose levels with IV insulin.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00532", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Which of the following statements is the best explanation for the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group?\"\n\"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma\nIntroduction:\nActive asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.\nMethods:\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.\nPatients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.\nAnalyses were performed from baseline to month 12.\nResults:\nAt baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants\nPulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants\nPlacebo: 395 participants\nTable 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities.

However, given that the patient is allergic to sulfa drugs, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (a sulfa-based antibiotic) would not be an option.\n\nBeta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins, inhibit cell wall synthesis (A). However, this is not the most specific mechanism of action for the antibiotic used in this case.\n\nThe fluoroquinolones inhibit DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are essential for bacterial DNA replication. However, this is not an option provided.\n\nThe answer that is closest to the correct mechanism of action is [B] Binds D-ala D-ala in the cell wall. However, this is actually the mechanism of action for beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins, which inhibit the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall by binding to the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that catalyze the cross-linking of peptidoglycan.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00539", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

His vital signs include: body temperature 39.0\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F), heart rate 120/min, and respiratory rate 18/min and regular. On physical examination, there is erythema, tenderness and enlargement of the thyroid gland that is worse on the left. Pain is worsened during neck hyperextension and relieved during neck flexion. Thyroid function tests are within normal limits. An ultrasound of the thyroid gland reveals a unifocal perithyroidal hypoechoic space. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism underlying this patient\u2019s condition? (A) Postviral inflammatory process (B) Pyriform sinus fistula (C) Antithyroid peroxidase (TPO) (D) Autoantibodies to the thyrotropin receptor (TRAb) The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B] \n\nThe patient's symptoms, including fever, malaise, intense pain in the anterior neck, and thyroid gland enlargement, are consistent with a diagnosis of a pyriform sinus fistula, also known as a thyroglossal duct cyst or a thyroglossal duct fistula. This condition typically presents in childhood and is often associated with a history of recurrent throat infections or abscesses. The presence of a hypoechoic space surrounding the thyroid gland on ultrasound is also consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nThe mechanism underlying this patient's condition is thought to be a congenital anomaly of the thyroglossal duct, which is a tube that forms during embryonic development and normally disappears by the 8th week of gestation. In some cases, remnants of the duct can persist and form a cyst or fistula, which can become infected and cause symptoms.\n\nThe other options are not the most likely mechanisms underlying this patient's condition:\n\n(A) Postviral inflammatory process: While postviral inflammation can cause thyroiditis, the patient's symptoms and ultrasound findings are more consistent with a pyriform sinus fistula.\n\n(C) Antithyroid peroxidase (TPO): This is an autoantibody associated with autoimmune thyroid disease, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The patient's thyroid function tests are within normal limits, making this option less likely.\n\n(D) Autoantibodies to the thyrotropin receptor (TRAb): These autoantibodies are associated with Graves' disease.

The patient\u2019s mother says he started complaining of pain in his abdomen after he got back from school yesterday and vomited 3 times during the night. This morning, he seemed confused so she rushed him to the ER. She has also noticed that he has been urinating frequently and drinking a lot of water recently, and he has lost 6 kg (13.2 lb) over the past 20 days. His vital signs include: blood pressure 100/50 mm Hg, heart rate 110/min, respiratory rate 27/min, and temperature 35.6\u00b0C (96.0\u00b0F). His BMI is 18 kg/m2. On physical examination, he is disoriented to time and place and is taking deep and labored breaths. There is diffuse tenderness to palpation in the abdomen with guarding. Laboratory tests are significant for a pH of 7.19 and a blood glucose level of 754 mg/dL. The doctor explains to his mother that her son has developed a life-threatening complication of a disease characterized by decreased levels of a hormone. Which of the following would you most likely expect to see in this patient? (A) Decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes (B) Decreased activity of hormone sensitive lipase (C) Decreased proteolysis (D) Increased lipoprotein lipase activity The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the symptoms and lab results provided, the patient is likely suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a complication of diabetes mellitus. DKA is characterized by decreased levels of insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels.\n\nThe correct answer is: (B) Decreased activity of hormone-sensitive lipase.\n\nIn DKA, the lack of insulin leads to increased levels of glucagon, which activates hormone-sensitive lipase. However, because the body's cells are resistant to insulin, the glucose cannot be taken up by the cells, and the glucose builds up in the blood. The hormone-sensitive lipase breaks down triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol, leading to increased ketone production. However, the decreased activity of hormone-sensitive lipase would not be expected in this scenario because the hormone is actually activated in DKA.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00552", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She reports nausea and vomiting and is unable to tolerate oral intake. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), the pulse is 92/min, the respirations are 18/min, and the blood pressure is 132/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows yellowish discoloration of her sclera. Her abdomen is tender in the right upper quadrant. There is no abdominal distention or organomegaly. The laboratory tests show the following results:\nHemoglobin 13 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 16,000/mm3\nUrea nitrogen 25 mg/dL\nCreatinine 2 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 432 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase 196 U/L\nAspartate transaminase 207 U/L\nBilirubin  \nTotal 3.8 mg/dL\nDirect 2.7 mg/dL\nLipase 82 U/L\nUltrasound of the right upper quadrant shows dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and multiple hyperechoic spheres within the gallbladder. The pancreas is not well visualized. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and metronidazole are initiated. After 12 hours, the patient appears acutely ill and is not oriented to time. Her temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (102.4\u00b0F), the pulse is 105/min, the respirations are 22/min, and the blood pressure is 112/82 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (A) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (B) Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (C) Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) (D) Percutaneous cholecystostomy The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D]\n\nExplanation: The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results suggest ascending cholangitis, a serious complication of biliary obstruction. The patient's fever, jaundice, and altered mental status are classic signs of ascending cholangitis. The ultrasound findings of dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and hyperechoic spheres within the gallbladder are consistent with bile duct obstruction and gallstones. The patient's clinical deterioration after initiation of antibiotic therapy suggests that the infection is worsening, and the bile duct obstruction is not being relieved.\n\nIn this scenario, the most appropriate next step in management is to relieve the bile duct obstruction and obtain cultures of the bile to guide antibiotic therapy. A percutaneous cholecystostomy is a minimally invasive procedure that involves placing a catheter into the gallbladder to drain the bile and relieve the obstruction. This can be done emergently and is a safe option for patients who are critically ill and not candidates for ERCP or surgery.\n\nERCP (A) is a more definitive procedure for relieving bile duct obstruction, but it carries a higher risk of complications, including pancreatitis and bleeding. It is usually performed after the patient has been stabilized and the infection has been controlled.\n\nLaparoscopic cholecystectomy (B) is a surgical procedure to remove the gallbladder, but it is not an emergent procedure and carries a higher risk of complications in critically ill patients.\n\nMagnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) (C) is a diagnostic imaging study that can visualize the bile ducts and gallbladder, but it does not relieve the obstruction and is not an appropriate next step in management in this scenario.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00553", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

(A) Spironolactone (B) Eplerenone (C) Triamterene (D) Ethacrynic acid The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B]\n\nExplanation: \nEplerenone is an aldosterone receptor antagonist that has a lower incidence of gynecomastia and impotence compared to spironolactone. Spironolactone is known to have anti-androgen effects, which can cause gynecomastia and impotence in some patients. Eplerenone, on the other hand, has a more selective affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor and is less likely to cause these side effects. Triamterene and ethacrynic acid are potassium-sparing diuretics, but they are not aldosterone receptor antagonists and would not be the best choice for this patient.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00554", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She was in her normal excellent state of health prior to this event. Two weeks ago, she had an upper respiratory infection (URI) but has since recovered. Her father has chronic kidney disease (CKD), bilateral hearing loss, and vision problems. At the hospital, her temperature is 40.3\u00b0C (104.5\u00b0F), blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respiratory rate is 24/min. On physical exam, the patient appears to have altered mental status and her skin is dry, hot, and erythematous. She is complaining of severe bilateral flank pain and generalized myalgia. Catheterization produces 200 mL of tea-colored urine. Urine dipstick is positive for blood, but urinalysis is negative for RBCs or WBCs. Which of the following is most likely responsible for her condition? (A) A mutation of the COL4A5 gene (B) Neisseria meningitides (C) Heat stroke (D) IgA nephropathy The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[C]\n\nExplanation: \n\nThis patient presents with symptoms of heat-related illness, including a high fever (40.3\u00b0C or 104.5\u00b0F), low blood pressure (85/55 mm Hg), and altered mental status. The presence of severe bilateral flank pain, generalized myalgia, and dry, hot, and erythematous skin further supports the diagnosis of heat stroke. The patient's recent history of upper respiratory infection and family history of chronic kidney disease are not directly relevant to her current presentation.\n\nHeat stroke is a medical emergency that occurs when the body's temperature regulation system is overloaded, causing the body temperature to rise rapidly and dangerously. It can be caused by exposure to high temperatures, physical exertion, or other factors that impair the body's ability to cool itself.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the patient's presentation:\n\nA. A mutation of the COL4A5 gene is associated with Alport syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys, hearing, and vision. However, this patient's symptoms do not match those typically seen in Alport syndrome.\n\nB. Neisseria meningitides is a bacterium that can cause meningitis, a serious infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. While this patient has a fever, her symptoms do not suggest meningitis.\n\nD. IgA nephropathy is a kidney disease characterized by the deposition of IgA antibodies in the kidneys.

He developed severe, crushing, substernal chest pain 10 hours ago while he was hiking in the Adirondack mountains. He was with 2 friends at the time who gave him aspirin before carrying him 5 miles to a town to get phone service, where they then called emergency medical services. His past medical history is notable for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He takes enalapril, metformin, and atorvastatin. He has a 20-pack-year smoking history and is an avid hiker. His temperature is 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 102/60 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, and respirations are 28/min. He is diaphoretic and intermittently conscious. Bilateral rales are heard on pulmonary auscultation. An electrocardiogram demonstrates ST elevations in leads I and aVL. Despite appropriate management, the patient expires. An autopsy is performed demonstrating ischemia in the left atrium and posterior left ventricle.

(A) Left anterior descending artery (B) Left circumflex artery (C) Left coronary artery (D) Right marginal artery The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B]\n\nExplanation: The patient's electrocardiogram demonstrates ST elevations in leads I and aVL, which are consistent with an occlusion of the left circumflex artery (LCx). The LCx supplies the lateral left ventricle, which includes the posterior left ventricle, as well as the left atrium. The left anterior descending artery (LAD) supplies the anterior left ventricle, which is typically associated with ST elevations in leads V2-V5. The left coronary artery is the main trunk that gives off the LAD and LCx. The right marginal artery supplies the right ventricle and is not typically associated with ST elevations in leads I and aVL. \n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and the autopsy findings, the most likely affected vessel is the left circumflex artery.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00567", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She first noticed her symptoms after she got off a rollercoaster ride 2 months ago. Physical examination shows weakness when extending the right wrist against resistance. An MRI of the head and neck is shown. This patient's condition is most likely the result of nerve root compression by a structure derived from which of the following embryologic layers? (A) Neural crest (B) Notochord (C) Neural tube (D) Surface ectoderm The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe answer is A.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with a pinched nerve in the neck, specifically the C6 or C7 nerve root, given the weakness in extending the wrist against resistance. The structure most likely responsible for this compression is a herniated disc, which is derived from the neural crest.\n\nDuring embryonic development, the neural crest is a population of cells that migrate from the neural tube and give rise to various structures, including the vertebrae and intervertebral discs. A herniated disc can compress a nearby nerve root, leading to the symptoms described.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\n* B) The notochord is a precursor to the vertebral column, but it does not give rise to the intervertebral discs.\n* C) The neural tube is the precursor to the brain and spinal cord, but it does not give rise to the intervertebral discs.\n* D) The surface ectoderm gives rise to various structures, including the skin and nervous system, but it is not directly involved in the formation of the intervertebral discs.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00576", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She states that she was in a kickboxing class when she suddenly developed left-sided abdominal pain. Her past medical history is significant for chlamydia. She is currently sexually active and does not use contraception. Her menstrual periods occur regularly every 30 days. Her last menstrual period ended 2 days ago. The patient\u2019s temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/68 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 14/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. On physical exam, there is left-sided, lower abdominal tenderness and guarding. Pelvic examination is notable for clear mucous in the vaginal introitus and tenderness of the left adnexa. A pelvic ultrasound with Doppler reveals a large amount of fluid in the rectouterine pouch. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Ectopic pregnancy (B) Ovarian torsion (C) Pelvic inflammatory disease (D) Ruptured ovarian cyst The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] \n\nExplanation: The patient's presentation of acute onset abdominal pain, especially with the history of chlamydia and regular menstrual periods, is concerning for a ruptured ovarian cyst or ovarian torsion. However, the presence of clear mucous in the vaginal introitus and tenderness of the left adnexa, along with the ultrasound findings of a large amount of fluid in the rectouterine pouch (indicative of a hemoperitoneum), points more towards a ruptured ovarian cyst. \n\nRuptured ovarian cysts are more common in women of reproductive age and are often associated with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which the patient has. The ultrasound findings of free fluid in the pelvis, along with the clinical presentation, are more consistent with a ruptured ovarian cyst than the other options. \n\nOvarian torsion is also a possibility, but the presence of clear mucous and fluid in the rectouterine pouch is more indicative of a ruptured cyst. Ectopic pregnancy is less likely given the patient's regular menstrual periods and the ultrasound findings. PID typically presents with more diffuse pelvic pain and possibly fever, which is not present in this case.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00577", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She also says her period has been delayed this month. She is afebrile. The pulse is 124/min and the blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. On examination, her abdomen is distended and tender. A pregnancy test was positive. A complication of infection with which of the following organisms most likely led to this patient\u2019s condition? (A) Candida albicans (B) Neisseria gonorrhoeae (C) Chlamydia trachomatis (D) Haemophilus influenzae The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B] \n\nReasoning: \n\nThis patient is pregnant and has a history of untreated pelvic infection, which suggests a possible case of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is a leading cause of infertility and ectopic pregnancy. \n\nConsidering the patient's symptoms, such as abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and a positive pregnancy test, an ectopic pregnancy is a likely diagnosis. \n\nEctopic pregnancy is often caused by a previous pelvic infection, particularly with Chlamydia trachomatis, which can cause scarring in the fallopian tubes and lead to an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. \n\nWhile Candida albicans can cause vaginal infections, it is not typically associated with ectopic pregnancy. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is also a cause of PID, but it is less common than Chlamydia trachomatis. Haemophilus influenzae is not typically associated with PID or ectopic pregnancy. \n\nTherefore, the most likely complication of infection that led to this patient's condition is Chlamydia trachomatis.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00592", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Mortality was studied in relation to age, sex, diagnosis, care pattern, and registration interval. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated, with the overall SMR being 1.63 (lower when compared with studies that looked at hospitalized individuals). Men and those in younger age groups showed higher mortality rates (SMRs of 2.24 and 8.82, respectively), and mortality was also higher in the first year following registration (SMR = 2.32). Higher mortality was also found in patients with a diagnosis of alcohol and drug dependence (SMR = 3.87). The authors concluded that the overall mortality of psychiatric patients managed in a community-based setting was higher than expected; however, it was still lower than the mortality described in other psychiatric settings. The primary measure used in this study can be defined as which of the following? (A) The total number of deaths divided by the mid-year population (B) The number of deaths in a specific age group divided by a mid-year population in that age group (C) The observed number of deaths divided by the expected number of deaths (D) The number of deaths from a certain disease in 1 year divided by the total number of deaths in 1 year The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[C]<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00608", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He is in a wheelchair with soft restraints because he has been violent and had been trying to hurt himself that day. The child\u2019s parents died in a car accident 1 month ago. His grandparents also brought the medications he stopped taking after his parents\u2019 death, including multivitamins, allopurinol, and diazepam. They say that their grandson has been using these medications for many years; however, they are unable to provide any medical history and claim that their grandson has been behaving strangely, exhibiting facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, and writhing movements for the past few days. They also note that he has had no teeth since the time they first met him at the age of 2. An intramuscular medication is administered to calm the boy down prior to drawing blood from him for laboratory tests. Which of the following biochemical pathway abnormalities is the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s condition? (A) Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase of the pyrimidine metabolism pathway (B) Aminolevulinic acid synthetase of the heme metabolism pathway (C) Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase of the purine metabolism pathway (D) Thymidylate synthetase of the pyrimidine metabolism pathway The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[C]\n\nExplanation: This patient is likely suffering from Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT), which is involved in the purine metabolism pathway. This deficiency leads to an accumulation of uric acid, causing symptoms such as gouty arthritis, kidney stones, and neurologic abnormalities, including involuntary movements and self-mutilation. The absence of teeth since the age of 2 is also consistent with this diagnosis, as HGPRT deficiency can lead to enamel hypoplasia, a condition where the enamel of the teeth does not develop properly. The administration of allopurinol, a medication that inhibits xanthine oxidase and reduces uric acid production, would be expected to worsen symptoms in a patient with HGPRT deficiency, as it would further reduce the conversion of hypoxanthine to guanine and increase the accumulation of uric acid.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00609", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Her last pregnancy was unremarkable and she gave birth to a healthy rhesus (RhD) positive girl. Her past medical history is notable for a blood transfusion after a car accident with a complex femur fracture about 3 years ago. Her temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), pulse is 92/min, and blood pressure is 138/82 mm Hg. Examination shows that the uterus is at the umbilicus. Ultrasound examination reveals normal fetal heart rate, movement, and anatomy. Routine prenatal labs show the following:\nBlood type A Rh-\nLeukocyte count 11,000/mm3\nHemoglobin 12.5 g/dL\nPlatelet count 345,000/mm3\nSerum\nAnti-D antibody screen Negative\nRubella IgM Negative\nRubella IgG Negative\nVaricella IgM Negative\nVaricella IgG Positive\nSTD panel Negative\nUrine\nProtein Trace\nCulture No growth\nCervical cytology Normal\nWhich of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?\" (A) Repeat antibody screening at 28 weeks.

Occasionally, he experiences palpitations, especially during strenuous activities. In addition to this, he has been experiencing difficulty in digestion and often experiences regurgitation and dysphagia. He reports that he emigrated from Mexico 20 years ago and visits his hometown twice a year. The vital signs include: blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg, respiratory rate 19/min, and pulse 100/min. The physical examination shows jugular vein distention along with pitting edema in the ankles. Bilateral basilar crackles and an S3 gallop are heard on auscultation of the chest. A chest X-ray is taken. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows no significant findings. What is the most likely explanation for this patient\u2019s physical and diagnostic findings? (A) Alcohol abuse (B) Hypertensive changes (C) Parasitic infection (D) Bacterial infection The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[C]\n\nRationale: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, palpitations, difficulty in digestion, regurgitation, and dysphagia, along with physical examination findings of jugular vein distention, pitting edema, bilateral basilar crackles, and an S3 gallop, are suggestive of Chagas disease. Chagas disease is a parasitic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, which is prevalent in Latin America. The patient's history of emigrating from Mexico 20 years ago and visiting his hometown twice a year increases the likelihood of exposure to the parasite. The ECG showing no significant findings is consistent with the chronic phase of Chagas disease, where cardiac involvement is more common. The chest X-ray findings would likely show cardiomegaly and/or pulmonary congestion, consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.\n\nThe other options are less likely explanations for the patient's findings:\n\n(A) Alcohol abuse can lead to cardiomyopathy, but it would not explain the patient's symptoms of difficulty in digestion and regurgitation.\n\n(B) Hypertensive changes can lead to left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure, but they would not explain the patient's symptoms of dysphagia and difficulty in digestion.\n\n(D) Bacterial infection can lead to endocarditis, but it would not explain the patient's symptoms of difficulty in digestion and regurgitation.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00612", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She says that the pain has been slowly worsening over the past 3 days. Otherwise, she complains of fatigue, a subjective fever, and a sunburn on her face which she attributes to gardening. The patient is an immigrant from Spain and works as an office assistant. She is not aware of any chronic medical conditions and takes a multivitamin daily. Her temperature is 98.7\u00b0F (37.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/64 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals bilateral redness over the maxillary prominences. Which of the following is most likely to be seen in this patient? (A) Decreased complement levels (B) Increased anti-centromere antibodies (C) Increased anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (D) Increased anti-topoisomerase antibodies The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[A] Decreased complement levels\n\nThis patient's symptoms of bilateral joint pain, fatigue, subjective fever, and characteristic bilateral redness over the maxillary prominences (butterfly rash) are highly suggestive of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and others. One of the hallmark laboratory findings in SLE is decreased complement levels, particularly C3 and C4, due to the consumption of complement by immune complexes. \n\nThe other options are not as directly related to the patient's presentation:\n\n- B (Increased anti-centromere antibodies) is more commonly associated with limited systemic scleroderma.\n- C (Increased anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies) is more commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis.\n- D (Increased anti-topoisomerase antibodies) is more commonly associated with systemic scleroderma.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00613", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Over the weekend, he scraped his left thigh when he fell on a muddy field while playing flag football with some friends. Since that time, he has had progressively worsening redness and pain in his left thigh. Past medical history is unremarkable. His temperature is 39.4\u00b0C (103.0\u00b0F), heart rate is 120/min, and blood pressure is 95/60 mm Hg. Physical exam is significant for a poorly-demarcated area of redness on his left thigh, extending to about a 10 cm radius from a small scrape. This area is extremely tender to palpation, and palpation elicits an unusual 'crunchy' sensation. CT scan shows free air in the soft tissue of the left leg. The organism that is most likely responsible for this patient's presentation is also a common cause of which of the following conditions? (A) Bacterial pneumonia (B) Bacterial sinusitis (C) Food-borne illness (D) Urinary tract infection The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[A] \n\nThe patient's presentation is consistent with necrotizing fasciitis, a severe infection of the soft tissue that can be caused by a variety of bacteria, including Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) and Staphylococcus aureus. However, the presence of free air in the soft tissue, which is a hallmark of gas gangrene, suggests that the patient's infection is more likely caused by Clostridium perfringens.

Haloperidol is an antipsychotic medication that can be used to manage agitation and aggression in patients with delirium tremens. However, it should be used cautiously and in conjunction with benzodiazepines, which are the primary treatment for DTs.\n\nIn this case, the best initial course of treatment would be to start the patient on benzodiazepines (not listed among the options) and monitor his condition closely.

He is extremely lethargic and is unable to provide an adequate history to his physician. His wife noted that roughly 3 days ago, her husband mentioned that something bit him, but she cannot remember what exactly. The vital signs include blood pressure 85/67 mm Hg, pulse rate 107/min, and respiratory rate 35/min. Upon examination, the man is currently afebrile but is lethargic and pale. His spleen is surgically absent. There are some swollen bite marks on his right hand with red streaks extending to his elbow. Which of the following bites would be most concerning in this patient?

(A) Decreased Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, normal diffusion distance (B) Decreased Aa gradient, increased surface area for diffusion, decreased diffusion distance (C) Increased Aa gradient, normal surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance (D) Increased Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] Increased Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance.\n\nExplanation: \n\nThis patient is presenting with signs of fluid overload and heart failure, indicated by his shortness of breath, crackles throughout the lungs, and jugular venous pulsation at the earlobe. The fact that he stopped taking his furosemide, a diuretic used to treat fluid overload, two weeks prior further supports this diagnosis. \n\nGiven the patient's presentation, the most likely cause of his shortness of breath is pulmonary congestion due to left-sided heart failure. This would result in an increased alveolar-arterial (Aa) gradient, indicating impaired gas exchange due to fluid in the lungs. The surface area for diffusion would be decreased due to the fluid congestion in the lungs, making it harder for oxygen to diffuse into the bloodstream.

This decrease in acid secretions is most likely due to the release of gastrin-inhibitory peptide (GIP) and somatostatin, which are secreted by enterochromaffin-like cells (ECL cells). However, the ECL cells actually stimulate the parietal cells to secrete more acid. The decrease in acid secretions at point D is more likely due to the release of other hormones such as GIP and somatostatin, but the correct answer is actually the cells that release these hormones are not listed, but the cells that stimulate the acid release are listed, so the closest correct answer would be the cells that stimulate the acid release, which is the ECL cells.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00645", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

They recently immigrated from another country, and do not have any previous medical records. The adolescent girl looks relatively short, but otherwise looks healthy. She has no complaints except for mild intermittent lower abdominal pain for the past year. On physical examination, vitals are within normal limits. There is the presence of axillary hair, breast development, and pubic hair at Tanner stage 5. You explain to the mother and the patient that you need to perform a complete vaginal examination, however, both of them declined the procedure and would prefer that lab test be performed. Her labs are significant for the following:\nFSH 7 mIU/mL\nNormal values:  \n   Follicular phase 3.1 \u2013 7.9 mIU/mL\n   Ovulation peak 2.3 \u2013 18.5 mIU/mL\n   Luteal phase 1.4 \u2013 5.5 mIU/mL\n   Postmenopausal 30.6 \u2013 106.3 mIU/mL\nEstradiol 28 pg/mL\nNormal values:  \n   Mid-follicular phase 27 \u2013 123 pg/mL\n   Periovulatory 96 \u2013 436 pg/mL\n   Mid-luteal phase 49 \u2013 294 pg/mL\n   Postmenopausal 0 \u2013 40 pg/mL\nTestosterone 52 ng/dL, 40 \u2013 60 ng/dL\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?

This suggests that she has functioning ovaries and is likely not experiencing menopause or premature ovarian failure. Her estradiol level is also within the normal range for the mid-follicular phase, which supports the presence of functioning ovaries.\n\nThe patient's Tanner stage 5 development (axillary hair, breast development, and pubic hair) indicates that she has undergone normal pubertal development, which further supports the presence of functioning ovaries.\n\nThe patient's short stature may be a concern, but it is not specific to any of the options provided. However, Turner syndrome is a condition characterized by short stature, ovarian dysgenesis, and other physical characteristics. Given the patient's normal FSH and estradiol levels, it is unlikely that she has Turner syndrome, but it is a consideration for further evaluation.\n\nMuellerian agenesis (option A) is a condition characterized by the absence of the uterus and upper part of the vagina, but it is often associated with normal ovaries and normal pubertal development. Hyperprolactinemia (option B) can cause amenorrhea, but it is not the most likely diagnosis given the patient's normal FSH and estradiol levels.\n\nAndrogen insensitivity (option D) is a condition characterized by the inability of the body to respond to androgens, which can lead to a failure of male sexual differentiation. However, this condition is not typically associated with amenorrhea or short stature in females.\n\nGiven the patient's normal FSH and estradiol levels, and her Tanner stage 5 development, the most likely diagnosis is a variant of normal development, possibly related to her short stature. However, further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause of her amenorrhea and short stature. \n\nA more likely diagnosis could be delayed puberty due to her Tanner stage 5 development, but since the patient is 18 years old, a diagnosis of primary amenorrhea with delayed puberty would be more appropriate.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00655", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Always answer in the form of [A], [B], [C], or [D].<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nA 62-year-old man presents with episodes of palpitations for the past 3 weeks. He says that he has episodes where he feels his heart is \u2018racing and pounding\u2019, lasting 1\u20132 hours on average. Initially, he says the episodes would happen 1\u20132 times per week but now happen almost every day. This last episode has been constant for the past 2 days. He denies any seizure, loss of consciousness, dizziness, chest pain, or similar symptoms in the past. His past medical history is significant for an ischemic stroke of the right anterior cerebral artery 1 month ago, status post intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with still some residual neurologic impairment, and long-standing gastroesophageal reflux secondary to a hiatal hernia, managed medically. The patient reports a 15-pack-year smoking history, but no alcohol or recreational drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, pulse 105/min, and respiratory rate 16/min. On physical examination, muscle strength in the lower extremities is 4/5 on the left and 5/5 on the right, along with sensory loss on the left, all of which is improved from his previous exam 3 weeks ago. There is a loss of the left half of the visual field bilaterally which is stable from the previous exam. Cardiac examination is significant for a new-onset irregular rate and rhythm. No rubs, thrills or murmurs. A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan shows evidence of an area of infarction in the vicinity of the right anterior cerebral artery showing normal interval change with no evidence of new hemorrhage or expansion of the area of infarction. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed, which is shown in the exhibit (see image below). Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to best prevent future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) in this patient? (A) Begin aspirin therapy (B) Begin clopidogrel (C) Carotid endarterectomy (D) Begin warfarin and heparin The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nSince I cannot view images, I will provide an answer based on general knowledge.\n\nGiven the patient's history of ischemic stroke and the new onset of irregular heart rate and rhythm, the most likely cause of the palpitations is atrial fibrillation (AF). Atrial fibrillation is a significant risk factor for stroke, and the CHA2DS2-VASc score can be used to assess the stroke risk.\n\nThe CHA2DS2-VASc score for this patient would be:\n- C: congestive heart failure (no)\n- H: hypertension (no)\n- A: age \u2265 75 (no)\n- 2: diabetes (no)\n- 2: previous stroke or TIA (yes)\n- S: stroke severity (yes)\n- 2: vascular disease (yes)\n- V: vascular disease (yes)\n- A: age 65-74 (yes)\n- S: sex category (male)\n- C: heart failure (no)\n\nThe total score is 6, which indicates a high risk of stroke.\n\nConsidering the patient's high risk of stroke, the most appropriate intervention to prevent future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) is to begin anticoagulation therapy.\n\n(A) Begin aspirin therapy is not the best choice because aspirin is an antiplatelet agent, which is less effective than anticoagulation therapy in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\n(B) Begin clopidogrel is also not the best choice because, like aspirin, clopidogrel is an antiplatelet agent.\n\n(C) Carotid endarterectomy is not the best choice because the patient's stroke was caused by an ischemic stroke of the right anterior cerebral artery, not a carotid artery disease.\n\n(D) Begin warfarin and heparin is the most appropriate choice because warfarin is an anticoagulant that can reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, heparin is typically used as a bridge therapy until warfarin reaches a therapeutic level.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\n(D) Begin warfarin and heparin<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00658", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Three weeks ago, he had a fever and a cough for 6 days after he returned from a trip to Southeast Asia. He has had a 4-kg (9-lb) weight loss over the past 3 months. He has bronchial asthma and hypertension. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 41 years. Current medications include an albuterol inhaler and enalapril. His temperature is 37.6\u00b0C (99.7\u00b0F), pulse is 88/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 136/89 mm Hg. There is dullness to percussion, decreased breath sounds, and decreased tactile fremitus over the left lung base. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. Chest x-ray of this patient is most likely to show which of the following? (A) Elevation of diaphragm (B) Ground glass appearance (C) Widened intercostal spaces (D) Blunting of costophrenic angle The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D]\n\nThis patient's presentation suggests a diagnosis of lung cancer, particularly given the history of weight loss, a long history of smoking, and the physical examination findings of dullness to percussion, decreased breath sounds, and decreased tactile fremitus over the left lung base. These findings are consistent with a pleural effusion, which is a common complication of lung cancer. The chest x-ray is most likely to show blunting of the costophrenic angle, which is a sign of pleural effusion. \n\nA pleural effusion would be characterized by an accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, leading to dullness to percussion, decreased breath sounds, and decreased tactile fremitus. The blunting of the costophrenic angle is a classic radiographic finding of a pleural effusion, where the normal sharp angle between the ribs and the diaphragm becomes rounded due to the accumulation of fluid.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00663", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He reports that he has a 15-year history of hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. He is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. Neurological examination shows decreased sensation to light pinprick and temperature on the right side of the face and body. Motor strength is 5/5 and deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally.

(A) Posterior limb of the internal capsule (B) Lateral medulla (C) Basal pons (D) Ventral thalamus The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe answer is [D].\n\nThis patient's presentation is consistent with a lacunar stroke, which is a small infarction (less than 1.5 cm in diameter) typically caused by occlusion of a small penetrating artery. The symptoms described (sudden-onset right-sided body numbness with decreased sensation to light pinprick and temperature, but preserved motor strength) are characteristic of a thalamic stroke, which often involves the ventral thalamus. \n\nThe ventral thalamus is involved in the transmission of sensory information from the spinal cord and brainstem to the cortex, and damage to this area can result in contralateral sensory deficits, as seen in this patient. The other options are not consistent with the patient's symptoms: the posterior limb of the internal capsule is typically involved in motor strokes, the lateral medulla is involved in Wallenberg's syndrome (which typically includes cranial nerve deficits and ataxia), and the basal pons is involved in pontine strokes (which typically include cranial nerve deficits and ataxia).<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00664", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

However, the normal complete blood count (CBC) makes a hematologic malignancy such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (A) less likely.\n\nThe coagulation profile shows a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 60 seconds, which suggests a problem with the intrinsic coagulation pathway. The prothrombin time (PT) is normal, indicating that the extrinsic coagulation pathway is intact.\n\nVon Willebrand disease (C) is a common bleeding disorder that affects the intrinsic coagulation pathway, but it typically presents with a normal aPTT and a prolonged ristocetin cofactor assay or von Willebrand factor antigen level.\n\nImmune thrombocytopenic purpura (B) is a condition characterized by low platelet count, which is not present in this patient.\n\nHemophilia A (D) is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of factor VIII, which is a critical component of the intrinsic coagulation pathway.

The patient's symptoms, including pain, decreased sensation, inability to move the leg, and the measured compartment pressure of 35 mm Hg, are all indicative of compartment syndrome.\n\nThe next best step in this patient's care is to perform an emergent fasciotomy, which involves surgically releasing the pressure in the affected compartment to restore blood flow to the tissues. This procedure should be done as soon as possible, ideally within 6-8 hours of the injury, to minimize the risk of permanent damage.\n\nThe other options are not the next best step in this patient's care. A venous doppler (B) may be useful in evaluating the patient's vascular status, but it does not address the acute compartment syndrome. An arteriogram (C) may be useful in evaluating the patient's arterial status, but it is not the immediate priority in this scenario.

There is no history of headaches, vomiting, or loss of consciousness. The past medical history is unobtainable due to a language barrier (the patient recently immigrated from abroad), but his wife says her husband had a motor vehicle accident when he was a teenager that required surgery. He is transferred to the ICU after a few hours in the ED because of dyspnea, cyanosis, and near-collapse. There are no signs of a meningeal infection. The Blood pressure was 70/30 mm Hg at the time of transfer. A chest X-ray at the time of admission showed interstitial infiltrates without homogeneous opacities. The initial laboratory results reveal metabolic acidosis, leukopenia with a count of 2,000/mm\u00b3, thrombocytopenia (15,000/mm\u00b3), and a coagulation profile suggestive of disseminated coagulation. A peripheral smear was performed and is shown below. Despite ventilatory support, administration of intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressor agents, the patient died the next day.

The gram stain from the autopsy specimen shows gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci occurring singly or in chains, which is characteristic of Streptococcus pneumoniae. \n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae is a gram-positive bacterium that can cause a variety of infections, including pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results, such as metabolic acidosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and disseminated coagulation, are consistent with a severe infection caused by S. pneumoniae.\n\nStaphylococcus aureus (A) typically forms clusters on gram stain and is more commonly associated with skin and soft tissue infections. \n\nStreptococcus pyogenes (B) is a gram-positive coccus that typically forms chains and is more commonly associated with pharyngitis and skin infections.\n\nNon-typeable H. influenzae (D) is a gram-negative coccus that is commonly associated with respiratory infections in children, particularly otitis media and pneumonia.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00684", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

However, the absence of purpura makes HSP less likely. The patient's history of a similar episode after a bicycle accident 1 year ago, and the presence of abdominal tenderness and intestinal wall thickening on ultrasound, suggest an allergic reaction or a vasculitis. \n\nThe most likely cause of this patient's condition is mast-cell activation. Mast cells release histamine and other chemical mediators, leading to vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and smooth muscle contraction. This can cause the symptoms observed in this patient, such as facial swelling, abdominal pain, and intestinal wall thickening. \n\nOther options are less likely:\n\n(A) Autoantibody-mediated tissue damage: This is characteristic of autoimmune diseases, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, which do not fit this patient's presentation.\n\n(B) Complement inhibitor deficiency: This is associated with conditions like hereditary angioedema (HAE), which typically presents with non-pruritic, non-erythematous swelling, and is not typically associated with abdominal pain or intestinal wall thickening.\n\n(C) Drug-induced bradykinin excess: This is also associated with hereditary angioedema (HAE), and is not the best fit for this patient's symptoms.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00685", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Over the past 2 days, he has also been feeling weak and tired. When standing up after sitting for a while, he feels dizzy. He says he has to go to the bathroom more often than usual, and that he is urinating \u201ca normal amount\u201d each time. He has not had diarrhea. He has hypertension, for which he has been taking hydrochlorothiazide for the past 6 months. He drinks 9 glasses of water per day and takes his medication regularly. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 90 kg (198 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. His temperature is 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F), blood pressure is 106/54 mm Hg, and pulse is 92/min. Physical examination shows whitening of the tongue. Skin that is pinched on the back of the hand retracts after 5 seconds.

Key findings include:\n\n1. Hyponatremia (Na+ 150 mEq/L) with normal serum osmolality (354 mOsm/kg).\n2. Hypovolemic signs (dizziness, weakness, and orthostatic symptoms) despite a normal urine output.\n3. High urine osmolality (400 mOsm/kg) with concentrated urine.\n4. Low serum potassium (K+ 3.6 mEq/L).\n5. Normal serum chloride (Cl\u2212 97 mEq/L) and bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212 30 mEq/L).\n\nThe patient's use of hydrochlorothiazide (a thiazide diuretic) could have led to hypokalemia (low potassium), but it is unlikely to cause hyponatremia and concentrated urine. Osmotic diuresis would typically result in a higher urine osmolality than serum osmolality, which is not the case here. Excess production of aldosterone could lead to hyponatremia and hypokalemia, but it would also cause hyperkalemia (high potassium) in the urine, which is not observed. Insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) would result in diabetes insipidus, characterized by hypernatremia and diluted urine, which is opposite to the patient's findings.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00696", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Her only complaint is difficulty losing weight. Her BMI is 34 kg/m^2. In addition to a standard physical exam, the physician orders a glucose tolerance test. The woman's fasting blood glucose level is 120 mg/dL and two-hour post 75g glucose load blood glucose level is 190 mg/dL. The physician informs the patient that she is \"pre-diabetic\" or at risk of developing diabetes and recommends lifestyle modification with follow-up in 6 months. Which of the following endogenous signaling molecules or receptors will increase insulin sensitivity in this patient? (A) Catecholamines (B) Glucagon (C) Glucocorticoids (D) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] \n\nExplanation: The patient in the scenario is pre-diabetic, as indicated by her impaired glucose tolerance test results (120 mg/dL fasting glucose and 190 mg/dL two-hour post-glucose load). To increase insulin sensitivity, the patient needs to activate pathways that enhance glucose uptake in the muscles and adipose tissue. \n\nPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) is a nuclear receptor that plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Activation of PPAR-\u03b3 has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity by promoting the expression of genes involved in glucose uptake, such as GLUT4. This makes [D] the correct answer.\n\nCatecholamines (A) are hormones that stimulate the breakdown of glucose, which would worsen insulin resistance. Glucagon (B) is a hormone that raises blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Glucocorticoids (C) are hormones that promote glucose production in the liver, which would also worsen insulin resistance.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00697", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She first started seeing double after a long day at her work as a radiation technologist. Since then, her vision has appeared to worsen in the evenings. She has also felt worsening fatigue despite no change in her work hours or sleep habits. She has a history of type I diabetes mellitus and her most recent hemoglobin A1c was 7.4%. Her family history is notable for Sjogren\u2019s syndrome in her mother and hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and carotid dissection in her father. Her temperature is 98.9\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 75/min, and respirations are 16/min. On examination, her pupils are equally round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact. Mild ptosis is noted bilaterally but worse on the left. A visual acuity test reveals no abnormalities.

(A) Pyridostigmine (B) Physostigmine (C) Hydrocortisone (D) Azathioprine The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D]\n\nExplanation: The patient's presentation of double vision, worsening fatigue, and mild ptosis is suggestive of myasthenia gravis (MG), an autoimmune disease characterized by weakness and fatigue of the muscles, particularly those involved in eye movement and swallowing. The patient's history of type I diabetes mellitus and family history of Sjogren\u2019s syndrome (another autoimmune disease) also support this diagnosis.\n\nPyridostigmine (A) is a cholinesterase inhibitor that is the first-line treatment for myasthenia gravis. It works by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby improving neuromuscular transmission.\n\nPhysostigmine (B) is also a cholinesterase inhibitor, but it is not typically used to treat myasthenia gravis due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and cause central nervous system side effects.\n\nHydrocortisone (C) is a corticosteroid that can be used to treat autoimmune diseases, but it is not the first-line treatment for myasthenia gravis.\n\nAzathioprine (D) is an immunosuppressive medication that can be used to treat autoimmune diseases, including myasthenia gravis, but it is typically used as an adjunct to pyridostigmine in patients who do not respond adequately to cholinesterase inhibitors.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate medication for this patient is pyridostigmine.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00700", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Physiological jaundice is a common condition in newborns, usually caused by the breakdown of red blood cells. It typically peaks between 3-7 days of age and resolves on its own without treatment. \n\nThe best treatment for physiological jaundice is to continue normal breastfeeding. Breast milk jaundice is a condition that occurs in some breastfed babies, where the bilirubin levels rise due to substances in the breast milk. However, in this case, the infant is a full-term infant, and the jaundice is likely due to physiological jaundice rather than breast milk jaundice.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n\nA) Phenobarbital administration is used to treat conditions such as kernicterus (a complication of untreated jaundice), but it's not the best initial treatment for physiological jaundice.\n\nB) Plasma exchange is not a standard treatment for physiological jaundice.\n\nC) Switching from breast milk to formula is not recommended unless there are other underlying issues with the infant's feeding or health.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00705", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

His mother notes that the symptoms started shortly after birth and have been progressively worsening. The patient is breast fed and takes no medications. His labs are within normal limits with the exception of his liver function tests as follows:\n\nALT: 8 U/ L\nAST: 10 U/L\nAlkaline phosphatase: 50 U/L\nAlbumin: 3.7 g/dL\nTotal protein: 6.7 g/dL\nBilirubin, total: 29.4 mg/dL\nBilirubin, unconjugated: 29.2 mg/dL\nBilirubin, conjugated: 0.2 mg/dL\n\nThe boy is taken immediately for treatment. What is the most likely underlying cause of his condition? (A) Absence of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1 (B) Alteration in the ankyrin protein (C) Reduction in UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1 activity (D) Deficiency in glucocerebrosidase The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[C]\n\nExplanation: The boy's symptoms, including jaundice (yellow sclerae), lethargy, and decreased muscle tone, suggest a severe case of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The laboratory results, particularly the elevated unconjugated bilirubin levels and normal conjugated bilirubin levels, support this diagnosis. The elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) may indicate some degree of liver stress or damage.\n\nThe most likely underlying cause of this condition is a reduction in UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1 (UGT1A1) activity. UGT1A1 is an enzyme responsible for conjugating bilirubin to make it water-soluble and excretable. A deficiency or reduction in UGT1A1 activity leads to a buildup of unconjugated bilirubin, causing jaundice and potentially kernicterus (a condition where bilirubin enters the brain and causes damage).\n\nThis condition is often referred to as Gilbert syndrome, but in this case, the severity of the symptoms suggests a more severe form of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, such as Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00709", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

However, I can provide a general explanation of how to determine the tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of urea based on a graph.\n\nThe tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of urea typically decreases along the proximal convoluted tubule due to reabsorption. This means that the ratio would be highest at the beginning of the proximal convoluted tubule and decrease as you move along the tubule.\n\nIf the graph in figure A shows the tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of urea along the proximal convoluted tubule, the correct answer would be the point where the ratio is the highest.\n\nSince I can't see the graph, I'll provide a general answer.

He reports alternating episodes of decreased urine output followed by a temporary increase in urine output for the past 2 days. In the past year, he has had two urinary tract infections. He has Crohn disease and underwent a small bowel resection 5 years ago. He currently takes mesalamine and a multivitamin. His father had recurrent kidney stones. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows right costovertebral angle tenderness. Urinalysis shows 70 RBC/hpf and envelope-shaped crystals. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a 6-mm stone in the proximal right ureter and two 4-mm stones in the left kidney. Which of the following factors has most likely contributed most to this patient\u2019s current condition? (A) Parathyroid gland adenoma (B) Excess vitamin D (C) Malabsorption of fatty acids (D) High urine pH The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] \n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms and urinalysis results suggest a diagnosis of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones). The presence of envelope-shaped crystals is characteristic of uric acid stones, which are more common in patients with low urine pH. The patient's history of Crohn disease and small bowel resection likely contributed to malabsorption of fatty acids, which are precursors to bile salts. Bile salts can increase the solubility of uric acid in urine, but this is not the correct answer choice. The patient's father had a history of kidney stones, which may suggest a genetic predisposition, but this is not the correct answer choice. The patient's urine pH is most likely low, which would increase the risk of forming uric acid stones. The presence of a 6-mm stone in the proximal right ureter and two 4-mm stones in the left kidney supports this diagnosis. \n\nA parathyroid gland adenoma (A) can contribute to hypercalcemia, which can increase the risk of forming calcium oxalate stones, not uric acid stones. Excess vitamin D (B) can also increase the risk of forming calcium oxalate stones. Malabsorption of fatty acids (C) is a possible consequence of the patient's history of Crohn disease and small bowel resection, but it is not the most likely contributing factor to the patient's current condition.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00711", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

This morning, she started a course of ceftriaxone for treatment of pyelonephritis. A photograph of the rash is shown. This patient's skin findings are most likely associated with which of the following? (A) Direct tissue damage by irradiated antibiotic agent (B) Cytotoxic T-cell destruction of antigen-tagged cells (C) Hyperpermeability of superficial dermal microvasculature (D) Mast cell activation in subcutaneous tissues The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is (C). \n\nThe patient's symptoms of a pruritic rash that developed after starting ceftriaxone are most likely due to a drug reaction. Ceftriaxone is a cephalosporin antibiotic, which can cause a type of drug reaction known as an allergic reaction. Allergic reactions can be caused by the release of histamine and other chemical mediators from mast cells, leading to increased permeability of the blood vessels, which can cause a rash. \n\nHowever, the more specific reaction to ceftriaxone is likely a maculopapular or urticarial rash due to an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. This reaction would be more accurately described as a type I hypersensitivity reaction, but the question does not provide enough information to accurately categorize the reaction.\n\nThe correct answer (C) describes the hyperpermeability of superficial dermal microvasculature, which is consistent with an allergic reaction.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00717", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The pain is 8 out of 10 in intensity and radiates down the legs. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy 4 years ago. She has hypertension, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and major depressive disorder. She lives with her daughter and reports frequent fights with her at home. Her current medications include sertraline, insulin, enalapril, sodium bicarbonate, and sevelamer. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 37.3\u00b0C (99.1\u00b0F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 132/94 mm Hg. There is severe tenderness on palpation over the L2 vertebra; range of motion is limited. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a common complication of CKD, caused by the imbalance of calcium and phosphate levels in the blood. In CKD, phosphate levels tend to rise, while calcium levels may fall due to impaired calcium absorption and increased excretion. This leads to increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, which in turn causes increased bone resorption and osteodystrophy. The patient's elevated serum calcium level and history of CKD make secondary hyperparathyroidism the most likely explanation for the wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra.\n\nTertiary hyperparathyroidism (A) is a more chronic and severe form of secondary hyperparathyroidism, often seen in patients on long-term dialysis. While it's possible, the patient's recent admission for dialysis and the presence of CKD make secondary hyperparathyroidism a more likely explanation.\n\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism (D) is a rare condition in patients with CKD, and the patient's laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.\n\nElder abuse (C) is a possibility given the patient's reports of frequent fights with her daughter, but there is no direct evidence to support this explanation for the patient's fracture.

(A) \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (B) Pyruvate kinase (C) Glutathione reductase (D) Carbonic anhydrase The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe correct answer is (B) Pyruvate kinase.\n\nBisphosphoglycerate mutase is an enzyme that participates in the final steps of glycolysis, specifically converting 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Elevated levels of bisphosphoglycerate mutase would likely lead to an accumulation of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. \n\nHowever, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate is a potent inhibitor of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), a key enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. Elevated levels of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate would inhibit PFK-1, which in turn would decrease the activity of the enzyme pyruvate kinase, as pyruvate kinase is downstream of PFK-1 in the glycolytic pathway.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00720", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

On arrival, she is stable and says that she hit a car at an intersection that \"came out of nowhere\". She states that she had similar close encounters with other cars these past few weeks but was able to avoid collisions with those. She has also had intermittent headaches over the last month and has noticed that her shirts have been getting wet unexpectedly. Blood tests reveal an abnormal elevation of a circulating substance. Which of following changes is also associated with the physiologic function of the most likely substance in this case? (A) Decreased oxytocin (B) Decreased progesterone (C) Increased follicle stimulating hormone (D) Increased progesterone The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo solve this question, let's analyze the symptoms and lab results:\n\n1. The patient has had close encounters with other cars, suggesting impaired reaction time or judgment.\n2. She has had intermittent headaches over the last month.\n3. Her shirts have been getting wet unexpectedly, implying excessive sweating or hyperhidrosis.\n4. Blood tests reveal an abnormal elevation of a circulating substance.\n\nConsidering these symptoms, the most likely substance is prolactin, which is a hormone involved in lactation and has a wide range of other effects, including:\n\n- Impaired reaction time or judgment (possibly due to its effects on the brain)\n- Headaches (possibly due to its effects on the brain)\n- Excessive sweating or hyperhidrosis (a common symptom of hyperprolactinemia)\n\nHyperprolactinemia is often associated with decreased dopamine, which is a neurotransmitter that inhibits prolactin release. However, among the options given, we need to identify a change that is associated with the physiologic function of the most likely substance (prolactin).\n\nThe correct answer is (A) Decreased oxytocin. Oxytocin is a hormone involved in social behavior, childbirth, and lactation. However, prolactin and oxytocin have a complex relationship, and their balance is crucial for lactation. During lactation, oxytocin stimulates milk ejection (letdown reflex), while prolactin stimulates milk production. In hyperprolactinemia, the balance between oxytocin and prolactin is disrupted, which may lead to decreased oxytocin levels.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Decreased oxytocin.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00721", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The bone biopsy confirms the diagnosis of vertebral osteomyelitis. \n\nOption B, intravenous ciprofloxacin and vancomycin therapy, is the most appropriate next step in management. Vertebral osteomyelitis is typically treated with a prolonged course of antibiotics, often with a combination of vancomycin and a fluoroquinolone (such as ciprofloxacin) for 6-12 weeks. \n\nOption A, lumbar puncture, is not indicated in this case as the infection is localized to the spine and not likely to involve the central nervous system.\n\nOption C, oral indomethacin therapy, is not appropriate for the treatment of vertebral osteomyelitis. Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can be used to treat conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis, but it is not effective against bacterial infections.\n\nOption D, bone scintigraphy, is not necessary in this case as the diagnosis of vertebral osteomyelitis has already been confirmed by biopsy.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00733", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 139 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nK+: 4.3 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 25 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 99 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.1 mg/dL\nCa2+: 12.2 mg/dL\nPTH: 8 pg/mL\n\nThe patient is referred to another physician for a more thorough workup including laboratory work and CT imaging. Which of the following is the best long-term prophylaxis for the cause of this patient\u2019s acute symptoms? (A) Alendronate (B) Calcitonin (C) IV fluids (D) Teriparatide The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D]\n\nRationale: The patient's presentation of confusion, somnolence, polyuria, and significant weight loss in the context of hypercalcemia (Ca2+: 12.2 mg/dL) and low PTH (8 pg/mL) suggests hypercalcemia of malignancy. The low PTH level is a red flag for malignancy-induced hypercalcemia. The most common cause of malignancy-induced hypercalcemia is parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) secreted by squamous cell lung cancer, breast cancer, or other malignancies. The best long-term prophylaxis for this condition is treatment of the underlying malignancy. Teriparatide is a recombinant form of PTH used to treat osteoporosis, and it is not the correct answer in this case. Alendronate is a bisphosphonate used to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy, but it is not the best long-term prophylaxis. Calcitonin is used to treat hypercalcemia but is not the best long-term solution. IV fluids are used to treat acute hypercalcemia but are not the best long-term prophylaxis.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00736", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He was driving a motorcycle and collided with a bus. The EMT personnel found the patient alert with anterograde amnesia for the several minutes preceding the accident. Vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, the patient is drowsy but follows commands. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. The remainder of the initial examination is unremarkable. While the patient is being transferred to observation, his level of consciousness acutely declines. Repeat vital signs are significant for a blood pressure of 190/110 mm Hg. Ophthalmic examination now shows a fixed and dilated left pupil with no pupillary light reflex. A noncontrast CT of the head is performed and is shown in the image. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient\u2019s condition? (A) Tearing of the middle meningeal artery (B) Dural arteriovenous fistula (C) Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysm (D) Arteriovenous malformation The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D]\n\nExplanation: \nThe patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to an aneurysmal rupture. The patient initially presented with anterograde amnesia, which suggests a loss of consciousness at the time of the accident. His subsequent decline in level of consciousness and the development of a fixed and dilated pupil on the left side of his head are consistent with increased intracranial pressure and possible herniation. The CT of the head shows blood in the subarachnoid space, which is characteristic of SAH. \n\nTearing of the middle meningeal artery (A) is more commonly associated with epidural hematoma, which presents with a lucid interval followed by a rapid decline in level of consciousness. Dural arteriovenous fistula (B) is a vascular malformation that can cause SAH but is less common. Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysm (C) is associated with hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage, which typically presents with a sudden onset of headache and focal neurologic deficits. Arteriovenous malformation (D) can cause SAH, but it is less common than aneurysmal rupture.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00740", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She worries she might eventually lose her balance and fall. She has had diabetes mellitus for 22 years. Her medications include folic acid, vitamin B12, amlodipine, and erythropoietin. At the clinic, her blood pressure is 135/80 mm Hg when lying down before dialysis and 110/55 mm Hg when seated after hemodialysis. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies after hemodialysis show a Hb of 10.5 mg/dL, a blood sugar of 189 mg/dL, and a hemoglobin A1C of 7.1%. To reduce the likelihood of falls, the most appropriate management is which of the following? (A) Cooling the dialysate (B) Eating heavier meals during dialysis (C) Increasing ultrafiltration (D) Steroid administration The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[A] \n\nThe patient's symptoms of feeling lightheaded after hemodialysis sessions, coupled with a decrease in blood pressure from 135/80 mm Hg when lying down to 110/55 mm Hg when seated, suggest orthostatic hypotension. This condition is common in patients undergoing hemodialysis due to the rapid removal of fluid from the body.\n\nTo reduce the likelihood of falls due to orthostatic hypotension, the most appropriate management would be to increase the sodium concentration in the dialysate. This is because a lower sodium dialysate can cause a greater amount of fluid to be removed from the body, leading to a more pronounced decrease in blood pressure. \n\nHowever, none of the options directly mention increasing sodium in the dialysate.

She developed worsening malaise and diaphoresis over the past 48 hours. Her maximum temperature was 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C) taken the night before presentation. Her past medical history is notable for major depressive disorder, obesity, fibromyalgia, and severe tension headaches. She previously took paroxetine for a 2-month trial but switched to citalopram 6 months ago as she did not feel like paroxetine was adequately helping her symptoms. Her mood has been stable on her current dose of citalopram. She takes ibuprofen for her headaches but previously borrowed a friend\u2019s headache medication when her headaches became very severe.

Goodpasture syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of anti-GBM antibodies that cause glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage.\n\nThe treatment for Goodpasture syndrome typically involves corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone, and immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide. However, the use of plasmapheresis is not a standard treatment for Goodpasture syndrome. Plasmapheresis is often used in other autoimmune diseases such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and myasthenia gravis.\n\nThe most appropriate treatment for this patient would be methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide, which are the standard treatments for Goodpasture syndrome.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00748", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Her blood pressure is 160/100 mm Hg and pulse is 67/min. Blood tests reveal high blood glucose and low potassium level. Abdominal CT scan shows a well-circumscribed homogeneous mass in the left adrenal gland. The hormone excess responsible for her symptoms uses which of the following pathways to exert its action? (A) Intracellular receptors (B) cAMP pathway (C) cGMP pathway (D) JAK/STAT pathway The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe answer is (B).\n\nBased on the patient's symptoms and the abdominal CT scan findings, the diagnosis is likely Cushing's syndrome due to an aldosterone-producing adenoma in the left adrenal gland. Aldosterone is a hormone that regulates electrolyte balance and blood pressure. It exerts its action through the mineralocorticoid receptor, which is a type of intracellular receptor (choice A). However, the primary effect of aldosterone is to increase sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the kidneys, which ultimately leads to increased blood pressure and hypokalemia.\n\nAldosterone's action is mediated through the cAMP pathway. When aldosterone binds to its intracellular receptor, it activates the transcription of genes involved in sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. The increased sodium reabsorption leads to increased sodium levels in the blood, which in turn activates the sodium-potassium pump in the kidneys. The activation of the sodium-potassium pump increases the intracellular concentration of cAMP, which activates protein kinase A (PKA). PKA then phosphorylates and activates the sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, leading to increased sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) cAMP pathway.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00749", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

(A) CT head (B) Ibuprofen (C) IV steroids (D) Lumbar puncture The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[C] \n\nExplanation: The patient's presentation is suggestive of a subarachnoid hemorrhage, given the severity and sudden onset of headache, along with jaw pain that worsens with chewing (known as jaw claudication). This is a classic symptom of temporal arteritis, which can be a complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient's elevated blood pressure and scalp tenderness further support this diagnosis. \n\nGiven the high suspicion of subarachnoid hemorrhage, the best next step in management is to perform a non-contrast CT head to quickly identify any hemorrhage or other acute intracranial pathology. \n\nOption (A) is the best choice because a non-contrast CT head can quickly identify hemorrhage or other acute intracranial pathology. \n\nOption (B) Ibuprofen is not the best choice as the patient's symptoms and elevated blood pressure may suggest a more serious underlying condition.\n\nOption (C) IV steroids may be useful in treating temporal arteritis, but it is not the best next step in management given the high suspicion of subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\nOption (D) Lumbar puncture is not the best next step as it is not typically used to diagnose subarachnoid hemorrhage, and may actually be contraindicated in cases of suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage due to the risk of cerebral herniation.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00750", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

In addition to intermittent nausea, he has mild weakness, tingling, and numbness in his left hand. With his affected hand, he is able to grip, but occasionally drops small objects. His oncologist tells him that one of his chemotherapy agents likely caused his neuropathy given its strong association with neurotoxicity. He was recently treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, and dasatinib. The culprit medication works by which of the following mechanisms of action?

She reports extreme fatigue since beginning her chemotherapy regimen. Her pulse is 98/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 132/84 mm Hg. Her hemoglobin is 10.4 g/dL, leukocyte count is 800/mm3 with 5% monocytes, and platelet count is 50,000/mm3. The patient is started on a new medication. One week later, serum studies show a hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 2,000/mm3 with 2% monocytes, and a platelet count of 56,000/mm3.

(A) Aldesleukin (B) Interferon beta (C) Filgrastim (D) Romiplostim The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] \n\nExplanation: \n\nThe patient's laboratory values show a decrease in all three blood cell lines (hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count) after starting a new medication. This pattern is consistent with bone marrow suppression, which is a common side effect of chemotherapy and some other medications.\n\nAldesleukin (A) is an immunotherapy agent that can cause a decrease in blood cell counts, but it is more likely to cause a decrease in leukocyte count.\n\nInterferon beta (B) is used to treat multiple sclerosis and can cause a decrease in blood cell counts, but it is more likely to cause a decrease in leukocyte count.\n\nFilgrastim (C) is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) that is used to stimulate the production of white blood cells and is not likely to cause a decrease in blood cell counts.\n\nRomiplostim (D) is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist that is used to stimulate the production of platelets and is not likely to cause a decrease in blood cell counts.\n\nHowever, the correct answer is actually none of the above. Based on the information provided, the most likely cause of these findings is the chemotherapy itself, which is not listed as an option.\n\nHowever, since the question is asking for a drug that can cause these findings, the best answer is Romiplostim is not the correct answer but it is the only option given that can increase platelet count.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00753", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He is unconscious upon arrival and is found to have severe internal bleeding due to trauma. He is taken for emergency surgery and severely damaged tissues are removed. After surgery, the boy is taken into the PICU for recovery. Over the subsequent week, serial labs are drawn showing target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis. He is started on a prophylactic regimen that is continued upon discharge. Which of the following is consistent with the mechanism of action of the drug that was most likely prescribed in this case? (A) 30S ribosome inhibitor (B) 50S ribosome inhibitor (C) Cell wall cross-linking inhibitor (D) DNA gyrase inhibitor The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe answer is B.\n\nExplanation: The boy's presentation with target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis after trauma and surgery suggests that he developed a post-surgical infection, likely a bacterial infection such as Staphylococcus aureus. The prophylactic regimen that was prescribed is most likely an antibiotic.\n\nThe mechanism of action of the most commonly prescribed antibiotic for post-surgical prophylaxis in this scenario is a 50S ribosome inhibitor, such as vancomycin. Vancomycin binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit of bacteria, preventing protein synthesis and ultimately leading to bacterial death.\n\nThe other options are not consistent with the mechanism of action of the drug prescribed in this case:\n\nA. 30S ribosome inhibitors, such as gentamicin, are aminoglycosides that bind to the 30S ribosomal subunit.\n\nC. Cell wall cross-linking inhibitors, such as vancomycin, do inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis, but they do so by binding to the D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of the bacterial cell wall precursors, preventing cross-linking, not by inhibiting protein synthesis.\n\nD. DNA gyrase inhibitors, such as ciprofloxacin, are fluoroquinolones that inhibit bacterial DNA replication by inhibiting DNA gyrase.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00772", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

On exam, the patient demonstrates severe excoriations in his perianal region with slight erythema over the areas that are torn. He does not have any other dermatologic findings. The scotch tape test is positive. The patient has a previous documented allergy to albendazole. Which of the following is an alternative medication that can be used?

The patient's allergy to albendazole, a benzimidazole, necessitates an alternative treatment. Ivermectin is a macrocyclic lactone that is effective against scabies and is often used as an alternative to topical permethrin or oral albendazole. \n\nAmphotericin B is an antifungal medication and would not be appropriate for treating scabies. Praziquantel is an anthelmintic used primarily to treat schistosomiasis and other fluke infections.

If a bullet were to penetrate the abdominal wall at this level, it could potentially injure the inferior vena cava.\n\nThe internal iliac vein (B) is a smaller vein that drains blood from the pelvic region, but it is not as likely to be injured at this level. The renal artery (C) is a major artery that supplies blood to the kidneys, but it is not located at the level of L3.

This pain has been accompanied by sleeping issues. Her friend recommended that she try yoga to relieve the pain, but she says this has not helped her at all. Se says the symptoms have begun to impact her daily functions and keep her from doing things she used to enjoy. Past medical history includes generalized anxiety disorder, for which she currently takes no medication. The patient had been previously medicated with paroxetine for 5 years. On physical examination, several areas of point tenderness are found on the occipital region, elbows, and medial surface of both knees. Laboratory work up is unremarkable. What is the best treatment option for the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. The presence of generalized anxiety disorder in the patient's past medical history also supports this diagnosis, as fibromyalgia often co-exists with anxiety and depression.\n\nThe best treatment option for fibromyalgia is often a multi-modal approach that includes medication, lifestyle modifications, and alternative therapies. However, among the options provided, allopurinol is sometimes used off-label to treat fibromyalgia, particularly in patients who have not responded to other treatments. Allopurinol is a medication typically used to treat gout, but it has been found to have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects that may be beneficial in the treatment of fibromyalgia.\n\nLow-dose prednisolone (A) may provide temporary relief from pain and inflammation but is not a long-term solution for fibromyalgia. High-dose prednisolone (B) is not recommended for fibromyalgia treatment due to potential side effects.

In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1\u00df, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia.

At this stage, the primary goal is to confirm the pregnancy and establish a baseline for fetal development. The patient is already taking prenatal vitamins and folate supplements, which is appropriate for her gestational age.\n\nAmniocentesis (A) and Chorionic villus sampling (C) are invasive diagnostic tests that are typically performed later in pregnancy (16-20 weeks and 10-12 weeks, respectively) to assess for chromosomal abnormalities or fetal anomalies. They carry a small risk of complications and are not indicated at this stage.\n\nCell-free DNA testing (B) is a non-invasive screening test that can be performed between 10-22 weeks of gestation to assess for chromosomal abnormalities. However, it is not the next best step in management at this stage, as it is not necessary for a low-risk pregnancy.\n\nRegular follow-up appointments (D) are the most appropriate next step in management, as they will allow the obstetrician to monitor the patient's health and the developing fetus, address any concerns or questions the patient may have, and provide education on prenatal care and pregnancy-related topics.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00785", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The plasma clearance of the drug is calculated as 15.0 L/h. Oral bioavailability of the drug is 75%. Sensitivity analysis of a sputum culture shows a minimal inhibitory concentration of 1 \u03bcg/mL for the causative pathogen. The target plasma concentration is 2 mg/L. If the drug is administered twice per day, which of the following dosages should be administered at each dosing interval to maintain a steady state? (A) 270 mg (B) 480 mg (C) 240 mg (D) 540 mg\n\" The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the dose required to maintain a steady state.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the volume of distribution (Vd) of the drug. However, the volume of distribution is not given. \n\nBut we can calculate the clearance (Cl) in terms of L/hour and then the dose in mg/hour, and then finally the dose in mg.\n\nThe formula to calculate the dose is: \n\nDose (mg/hour) = (Cl x Target concentration) / F \n\nWhere F is the bioavailability of the drug. \n\nFirst, we need to convert the target concentration from mg/L to \u03bcg/mL. \n\n1 mg/L = 1 \u03bcg/mL (since 1 mg = 1000 \u03bcg and 1 L = 1000 mL)\n\nTarget concentration = 2 mg/L = 2 \u03bcg/mL\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nDose (mg/hour) = (15.0 L/h x 2 \u03bcg/mL) / 0.75 \n\nDose (mg/hour) = 40 mg/hour\n\nSince the drug is administered twice per day, the dose per administration is half of the dose per hour. \n\nDose per administration = 40 mg/hour / 2 \n\nDose per administration = 20 mg/hour \n\nTo convert this to a total dose per administration in mg, we need to multiply by the number of hours between doses. \n\nSince the drug is administered twice per day, the number of hours between doses is 12 hours. \n\nDose per administration = 20 mg/hour x 12 hours \n\nDose per administration = 240 mg\n\nThe answer is [C].<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00791", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Nitric oxide is produced from the amino acid arginine by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS). In GCA, the inflammation of the blood vessels can lead to a decrease in the expression and activity of endothelial NOS (eNOS), resulting in decreased production of nitric oxide and a corresponding decrease in arginine concentrations. \n\nNitric oxide plays a crucial role in vascular relaxation and vasodilation, and its decreased production can contribute to the vascular complications seen in GCA.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00796", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Before being able to start the physical examination, the patient loses consciousness. Her pulse is palpable but weak. Her blood pressure is now 88/50 mmHg and pulse is 130/min. Her skin is pale, cold, and clammy. An electrocardiogram demonstrates ST elevations in leads I, aVL, V3, V4, V5, and V6. A medication that primarily stimulates which of the following receptors would be most appropriate to improve the hemodynamic status of this patient? (A) Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor (B) Beta-1 adrenergic receptor (C) Beta-2 adrenergic receptor (D) D2 receptor The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B]\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe patient is experiencing a myocardial infarction with signs of shock, including hypotension (88/50 mmHg), tachycardia (130/min), and cool, clammy skin. To improve her hemodynamic status, a medication that increases heart rate and contractility would be beneficial. \n\nBeta-1 adrenergic receptors are primarily found in the heart, where their activation increases heart rate and contractility. The medication most commonly associated with beta-1 adrenergic receptor stimulation is dobutamine, which is used to treat acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock. However, the question is asking for the receptor type, not the medication.\n\nDobutamine is a non-selective beta-adrenergic agonist that also stimulates beta-2 adrenergic receptors. However, in the context of cardiogenic shock, the primary effect of dobutamine is through beta-1 adrenergic receptor stimulation.\n\nAlpha-2 adrenergic receptors are primarily involved in decreasing sympathetic tone and would not be beneficial in this scenario. Beta-2 adrenergic receptors are involved in smooth muscle relaxation, which would not improve the patient's hemodynamic status. D2 receptors are involved in dopamine's anti-emetic and antipsychotic effects and are not relevant to this patient's condition.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00800", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She reports that diarrhea has been intermittently present for the past month. The stool is often loose and associated with blood and lower abdominal pain. She denies any recent travel history, and she works at a nursing home as a caretaker. She is not currently on any medications. Clinical examination shows mild tenderness in the suprapubic region, and there is no organomegaly. Findings on colonoscopy include patchy erythema and ulceration in the cecum, ascending, descending, and sigmoid colon. Mucosal biopsy shows colonic crypts with lymphocytic and neutrophilic infiltrates. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Paramedics report extensive blood loss at the scene where he was found. Due to his Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3, an endotracheal airway and large-bore access are secured prior to arrival. He is aggressively resuscitated with a massive transfusion protocol as the operating room is prepared for an exploratory laparotomy. An arterial line and central access are obtained. His temperature is 95\u00b0F (35\u00b0C), blood pressure is 50/40 mmHg, and pulse is 80/min, and respirations are controlled at 20/min on lung-protective volume control. After a 6:6:1 ratio of red blood cells, plasma, and platelets and the use of continuous phenylephrine infusion, the patient's vital signs remain the same. The surgical team reports no active blood loss. A stat ScvO2 results as 39% with a SaO2 of 100% on 100% oxygen. His extremities remain cold despite having the ambient room temperature increased to 80\u00b0F (26.7\u00b0C). What is the most likely cause of his presentation? (A) Cardiac tamponade (B) Cervical spinal cord transection (C) Pulmonary embolism (D) Undiagnosed pneumonia The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B] \n\nThe patient's presentation is consistent with a spinal cord injury, likely a cervical spinal cord transection. This is evidenced by the following:\n\n1. Low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3, suggesting impaired consciousness.\n2. Hypotension despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.\n3. Low ScvO2 (39%) despite high SaO2 (100%) on 100% oxygen, indicating inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues.\n4. Cold extremities despite increased ambient temperature, suggesting impaired vasodilation and perfusion.\n5. No active blood loss reported by the surgical team.\n\nThese findings are classic for a spinal cord injury, which can lead to autonomic dysfunction, including impaired vasodilation and decreased perfusion to peripheral tissues.

She has just learned that she is pregnant and estimates she is approximately 6 weeks pregnant given the timing of her last menstrual cycle. She has a history of recurrent fetal loss. In total, she has had 4 miscarriages between the gestational ages of 8 and 15 weeks. She has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus and has had several DVTs in the past and a clot in her lung once. Her vitals today are unremarkable. She is asking if there are any treatments she should receive to prevent fetal loss. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient? (A) Aspirin and heparin (B) Aspirin and warfarin (C) No treatment indicated (D) Rivaroxaban The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[A] \n\nThis patient has a history of recurrent fetal loss, systemic lupus erythematosus, and thromboembolic events. The most appropriate management for her is low-dose aspirin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Aspirin has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent pregnancy loss in women with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which is often associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. However, in this case, there is no mention of antiphospholipid antibodies. Nonetheless, the patient's history of recurrent fetal loss and thromboembolic events warrants anticoagulation. \n\nAspirin and warfarin is not the best choice because warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist that can cross the placenta and cause fetal harm, including warfarin embryopathy and fetal bleeding. \n\nNo treatment is indicated because the patient has a history of recurrent fetal loss and thromboembolic events, which warrants anticoagulation.\n\nRivaroxaban is not the best choice because it is a direct oral anticoagulant that is not typically used in pregnancy due to a lack of long-term safety data.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00819", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She is 168 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 63 kg (139 lb); BMI is 22.3 kg/m2. Examination shows normal breast development. Scant axillary hair is present. Abdominal examination shows a firm, nontender left inguinal mass. Pelvic examination shows a blind vaginal pouch. Ultrasonography does not show a uterus or ovaries.

MRKH is characterized by the absence of a uterus and upper vagina, with normal ovarian function. The presence of normal breast development and scant axillary hair suggests that the patient has undergone normal pubertal development, which is consistent with this diagnosis. \n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA) 5-\u03b1 reductase deficiency is a condition that affects the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, leading to ambiguous genitalia in affected males.\n\nB) Sex chromosome mosaicism refers to the presence of more than one cell line with different sex chromosome patterns. This can lead to a variety of clinical presentations, but is not typically associated with the absence of a uterus and ovaries.\n\nC) Sex chromosome monosomy refers to the presence of only one sex chromosome (e.g., 45,X in Turner syndrome). While Turner syndrome can be associated with ovarian dysgenesis, it is typically associated with short stature and other physical abnormalities, which are not present in this patient.\n\nD) Androgen insensitivity is a condition in which the body is unable to respond to androgens, leading to a female phenotype despite the presence of testes. This is consistent with the patient's presentation of normal breast development and scant axillary hair. However, the presence of a blind vaginal pouch and absence of a uterus suggests that the patient has undergone normal pubertal development, making MRKH syndrome a more likely diagnosis.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00820", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Past medical history is significant for sickle cell anemia. Physical examination is significant for severe tenderness to palpation in the left upper quadrant. Significant splenomegaly is also noted. The patient is admitted to the hospital for close observation and placed on deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis as part of a routine protocol. Laboratory findings drawn sometime after admission demonstrate a normal prothrombin time (PT) and elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Which of the following factors is most directly affected by the DVT prophylaxis? (A) VII (B) VIIa (C) X (D) XII The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D]\n\nThe DVT prophylaxis most likely refers to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin, which are both anticoagulant medications. Heparin works by activating antithrombin, which in turn inhibits the coagulation cascade, specifically by inactivating factors IIa, Xa, IXa, XIa, and XIIa. Factor XII is the most directly affected by heparin, as it is a major target of antithrombin in the heparin-antithrombin complex. This is why the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is elevated in patients on heparin therapy, as it measures the time it takes for blood to clot in the presence of factor XII and other coagulation factors.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00824", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Her last period occurred 4 months ago but she has not had sex in the last year and home pregnancy tests have come back negative. She first started having periods at age 13 and her periods have been unremarkable up until they stopped 4 months ago. Her past medical history is significant for radius and ulnar forearm fractures that she sustained in a car crash 3 months ago. She didn't see the car coming and has had increasing difficulty noticing objects in her peripheral vision. She also notes having recurrent headaches 5 months ago. Otherwise she has been healthy with no previous pregnancies. Physical exam reveals galactorrhea and temporal field visual defects.

This type of tumor secretes prolactin, which can inhibit the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), leading to decreased production of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This decrease in LH and FSH levels results in decreased estrogen production, leading to amenorrhea.

The combination of these findings, particularly the presence of ascites and splenomegaly, is highly suggestive of liver cirrhosis.\n\nThe patient's history of hematemesis (vomiting blood) is also consistent with cirrhosis, as portal hypertension (a complication of cirrhosis) can lead to the formation of varices in the esophagus or stomach, which can bleed easily.\n\nThe options can be ruled out as follows:\n\nA) Metabolic disorder: While certain metabolic disorders can cause liver dysfunction, the patient's presentation is more suggestive of cirrhosis.\n\nB) Substance abuse: The patient's homelessness and lack of a clear history make it difficult to assess the likelihood of substance abuse. However, the presence of cirrhosis is more directly related to the patient's physical examination findings.\n\nC) Obesity: Obesity is not directly related to the patient's liver dysfunction or physical examination findings.\n\nD) Hepatic venous outflow obstruction: This option is the most likely cause of the patient's illness.

When used together, they can increase the risk of hyperkalemia, a condition characterized by elevated potassium levels in the blood. This is because ACE inhibitors can increase potassium levels by reducing aldosterone levels, which in turn increases potassium reabsorption in the kidneys.

She has been unable to recall her husband's name or their address. She has had insomnia and daytime sleepiness during this period. Her last bowel movement was 3 days ago. One month ago, she underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portal shunt (TIPS) placement. She has alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Current medications include spironolactone and furosemide. She used to drink over a pint of vodka daily but quit 2 months ago. She is oriented to place and person. Her temperature is 37.3\u00b0C (99.1\u00b0F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 102/64 mm Hg. Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. There are several telangiectasias over the chest and back. Palmar erythema is present. The abdomen is mildly distended and nontender. Shifting dullness is present. There is a flapping tremor of both hands when outstretched and dorsiflexed. Neurologic examination shows no other focal findings.

The presence of jaundice, scleral icterus, and telangiectasias also supports a diagnosis of liver disease. The patient's history of TIPS placement and alcoholic liver cirrhosis further supports this diagnosis. Hepatic encephalopathy is a complication of liver disease that can be managed with lactulose, a non-absorbable disaccharide that helps to reduce ammonia levels in the blood, which are thought to contribute to the development of hepatic encephalopathy. \n\nReversal of TIPS (A) may be necessary in some cases, but it is not the immediate next step in management. Paracentesis (B) may be necessary to relieve ascites, but it does not directly address the hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient has presented three times this past month with similar complaints. The patient sees no primary care physician and is currently not taking any medications. The patient states his shortness of breath started when he was walking from his car to a local restaurant. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), pulse is 100/min, blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. On physical exam you note a fatigued appearing gentleman. Cardiovascular exam reveals an additional heart sound after S2. Pulmonary exam is notable for bilateral crackles. Abdominal exam reveals an obese abdomen without pain in any of the quadrants. Lower extremity pitting edema is noted bilaterally. Which of the following sets of lab values most likely corresponds to this patient's presentation? (A) High BNP, high ADH, high sodium, high potassium (B) High BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, low potassium (C) High BNP, high ADH, low sodium, low potassium (D) Low BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, normal potassium The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B] High BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, low potassium.\n\nExplanation:\n\n- High BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide): The patient's presentation of shortness of breath, bilateral crackles, and lower extremity pitting edema, along with an additional heart sound after S2, is suggestive of heart failure. Elevated BNP levels are commonly seen in patients with heart failure.\n\n- Low ADH (Antidiuretic hormone): In heart failure, there is often a decrease in ADH levels due to the failure of the heart to effectively pump blood to the kidneys, leading to decreased ADH secretion. This results in increased urine production (polyuria) and decreased water reabsorption in the kidneys, leading to a decrease in serum sodium levels.\n\n- Normal sodium: While hyponatremia (low sodium) is a common finding in heart failure due to decreased ADH levels, the patient's sodium level is normal. However, this can be seen in patients with mild heart failure.\n\n- Low potassium: The patient's presentation of heart failure and the use of the heart as a \"pump\" results in increased potassium excretion in the urine, leading to hypokalemia (low potassium).\n\nThis patient's presentation and lab values suggest that he is experiencing heart failure, likely due to a condition such as left ventricular dysfunction or valvular disease.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00852", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The patient recently started college and has presented to the emergency department once before for polysubstance intoxication. The patient attempts to assault a nurse, is restrained, and given diphenhydramine and haloperidol. When the patient is able to be examined, he is somnolent and non-responsive. His temperature is 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C), blood pressure is 147/98 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. He does not comply with any commands, and it is not possible to freely manipulate his extremities due to rigidity. His mucous membranes are dry. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Catatonic schizophrenia (B) Heat stroke (C) Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (D) Oversedation The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[C]\n\nRationale: The patient's presentation of fever (104\u00b0F), autonomic instability (elevated blood pressure, pulse, and respirations), and muscle rigidity in the setting of recent administration of haloperidol (a typical antipsychotic) suggests Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). NMS is a life-threatening condition that is associated with the use of antipsychotic medications, particularly typical antipsychotics like haloperidol. The symptoms of NMS can include fever, autonomic instability, muscle rigidity, and altered mental status. In this case, the patient's recent history of polysubstance intoxication and the administration of haloperidol make NMS the most likely diagnosis.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00854", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She is concerned about his leg and his inability to stand. He was born vaginally to a 33-year-old woman (gravida 3, para 2) from an uncomplicated pregnancy at 39 weeks. He has met all developmental milestones and is up to date on all vaccinations. His mother explains that he can normally stand without help and can walk briefly on his own. However, he hit his right leg against a chair 2 days ago. The area became edematous and bruised overtime and the infant became unable to stand or crawl and cries when he puts weight on it. The mother denies any child abuse from her family or child care. The patient\u2019s vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 80/40 mm Hg, heart rate 137/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and temperature 36.7\u00b0C (97.0\u00b0F). His length and weight are both between the 15th and 25th percentile. On physical examination, blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae are noted. Respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations are within normal limits for his age. There is joint hypermobility and decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities. The patient\u2019s right calf appears slightly deformed, edematous, and warm to the tough. The patient begins to cry loudly when the physician palpates his leg. The patient\u2019s X-ray shows an incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis. What is the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms? (A) Insufficient production of procollagen type 1 (B) Mutation in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (C) Defective collagen type 3 (D) Dysfunctional structure of laminins The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[A]\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms, including joint hypermobility, decreased muscle tone, and blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae (also known as blue sclerae), are characteristic of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI), a genetic disorder that affects the production of collagen. Collagen is a protein that provides structure and strength to bones, teeth, and other connective tissues. The blue sclerae are due to the transparency of the collagen in the sclerae. \n\nThe patient's incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis and the mother's history of similar symptoms in previous pregnancies (although not explicitly stated, it can be inferred) further support this diagnosis. The mother's previous history of having children with similar symptoms is a strong indicator of an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which is typical for OI. \n\nOption A, insufficient production of procollagen type 1, is the correct answer because OI is caused by mutations in the genes that encode the collagen type 1 alpha 1 (COL1A1) and alpha 2 (COL1A2) chains, which are involved in the production of procollagen type 1. This leads to a deficiency in the production of functional collagen type 1, resulting in fragile bones that are prone to fractures. \n\nOption B refers to Marfan syndrome, a different genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the gene encoding fibrillin-1. Marfan syndrome is characterized by tall stature, long limbs, and aortic root dilation, but it does not typically present with blue sclerae or the other symptoms described in this case.\n\nOption C, defective collagen type 3, is associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a group of disorders that affect the production of collagen type 3. While Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can cause joint hypermobility and skin hyperextensibility, it is not typically associated with blue sclerae or the bone fragility seen in OI.\n\nOption D, dysfunctional structure of laminins, is not directly related to the symptoms described in this case. Laminins are a family of proteins that are involved in the structure of the basement membrane, a layer of tissue that separates epithelial and endothelial cells from the underlying connective tissue. While laminins play a role in tissue development and function, they are not directly involved in the pathogenesis of OI.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00867", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

A study is done with a null hypothesis that there is no association between alcohol use and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The data obtained shows, of the 200 alcoholics who were followed-up, 30 developed GERD; and out of the 400 non-alcoholics, 30 developed GERD. What fraction of GERD can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed in this town? (A) 45/195 (B) 30/400 (C) (30/200) / (30/400) (D) 30/200 The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the incidence rate of GERD among alcoholics and non-alcoholics.\n\nIncidence rate among alcoholics = 30/200 = 0.15\nIncidence rate among non-alcoholics = 30/400 = 0.075\n\nRelative risk (RR) = Incidence rate among alcoholics / Incidence rate among non-alcoholics = 0.15 / 0.075 = 2\n\nThis means that the risk of GERD is twice as high among alcoholics as among non-alcoholics.\n\nAttributable risk (AR) = Incidence rate among alcoholics - Incidence rate among non-alcoholics = 0.15 - 0.075 = 0.075\n\nThis is the risk that can be attributed to alcohol consumption.\n\nAttributable fraction (AF) = AR / Incidence rate among alcoholics = 0.075 / 0.15 = 0.5\n\nHowever, we are interested in the fraction of GERD that can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed. \n\nThe fraction of GERD that can be prevented = AF = 0.5 = 50%\n\nHowever, since we are looking for the fraction, the answer should be expressed as a fraction. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\n50% = 1/2 = 100/200 = (100/200) / (30/200) = (100/200) / (30/400) = 100/200 / (30/400) = 100/200 * 400/30 = 200/30 * 1/2 = (200*1)/(30*2) = 100/30 = 10/3 = 10/3 * 1/1 = (10*1)/(3*1) = 10/3<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00870", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He also mentions that he has grossly bloody stool and most of the time an urge to defecate. He has a history of bulimia with laxative abuse several years ago. He admits having lost about 5 lb in the past month. His temperature is 37\u00b0 C (98.6\u00b0 F), respiratory rate is 15/min, pulse is 77/min, and blood pressure is 105/86 mm Hg. On physical examination, a mild conjunctival pallor is evident, and the rectum is erythematous, indurated, and tender. Colonoscopy demonstrates continuous mucosal lesions throughout the rectum to the hepatic flexure of the colon. What is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Ulcerative colitis (B) Celiac disease (C) Irritable bowel syndrome (D) Crohn\u2019s disease The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] \n\nThe patient's symptoms of abdominal discomfort, cramping, bloody stool, and the urge to defecate, combined with the physical examination findings of a tender and erythematous rectum, suggest a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The colonoscopy findings of continuous mucosal lesions throughout the rectum to the hepatic flexure of the colon are consistent with ulcerative colitis. However, the patient's history of laxative abuse may also increase the risk of colorectal complications, such as ischemic colitis or toxic megacolon, which could also present with similar symptoms. But the most likely diagnosis is ulcerative colitis due to the continuous nature of the mucosal lesions and the absence of extraintestinal symptoms that are more common in Crohn's disease.\n\nCrohn's disease typically presents with skip lesions and is more likely to cause extraintestinal symptoms such as joint pain, skin rashes, and eye inflammation. Ulcerative colitis typically presents with continuous mucosal lesions and is more likely to cause symptoms such as diarrhea, urgency, and rectal bleeding.\n\nCeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the small intestine and is characterized by symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. It is not typically associated with the symptoms and colonoscopy findings described in this patient.\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder that is characterized by symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits.

He was recently diagnosed with stage 3 embryonal carcinoma testicular cancer. Following an orchiectomy, he was placed on chemotherapy. Cardiopulmonary examination shows fine inspiratory crackles bilaterally. There is clubbing present in the fingers bilaterally. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) show FVC is 78% of expected and FEV1/FVC ratio is 92%. A CT scan of the chest is shown. Which of the following drugs is responsible for the patient\u2019s condition? (A) Bleomycin (B) Carboplatin (C) Cisplatin (D) Ifosfamide The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B], [C], or [D] could be the answer, but the most likely one is [C]. \n\nCisplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent that is commonly used in the treatment of testicular cancer. One of the side effects of cisplatin is pulmonary toxicity, which can manifest as interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pulmonary fibrosis. The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, fine inspiratory crackles bilaterally, and clubbing are consistent with pulmonary fibrosis.\n\nThe patient's PFTs show a relatively preserved FEV1/FVC ratio, which suggests that the lung disease is primarily restrictive in nature, consistent with pulmonary fibrosis.\n\nWhile bleomycin (A) is also a chemotherapeutic agent that can cause pulmonary toxicity, it is more commonly associated with pneumonitis rather than pulmonary fibrosis. Carboplatin (B) and ifosfamide (D) are also chemotherapeutic agents that can cause pulmonary toxicity, but they are less commonly associated with pulmonary fibrosis than cisplatin.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00882", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

On admission, a complete blood count showed a hemoglobin concentration of 15.5 g/dL and a leukocyte count of 14,000/mm3. Urinalysis showed 2+ proteinuria, and serum studies showed a blood glucose of 145 mg/dL and a creatinine concentration of 1.2 mg/dL. A CT scan of the abdomen confirmed the diagnosis. Therapy with intravenous ketoprofen, piperacillin, and tazobactam was begun, and the patient was placed on bowel rest. He has a history of hypertension, chronic constipation, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin, metoprolol, and losartan. Today, his temperature is 37.7\u00b0C (99.9\u00b0F), pulse is 97/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 135/87 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft on physical examination, and there is tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities.

(A) Gastrointestinal blood loss (B) Adverse drug reaction (C) Dehydration (D) Contrast administration The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B] \n\nExplanation: The patient's presentation of reduced urine output and elevated serum creatinine concentration three days after hospitalization is suggestive of acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which increases the risk of AKI. The patient was initially treated with piperacillin and tazobactam, but the addition of intravenous ketoprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), may have contributed to the development of AKI. NSAIDs can cause AKI by reducing renal blood flow and impairing renal function, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal disease. The patient's history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus increases the risk of NSAID-induced AKI. The patient's current medications include metoprolol, which is unlikely to cause AKI, and losartan, which may actually protect against AKI. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's current renal findings is an adverse drug reaction to intravenous ketoprofen.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00883", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She states that the pain started 1 hour ago after rugby practice. Typically, she takes a special medication for bad headaches, but this time she took 2 doses and noticed no improvement in her symptoms. The patient's current medications that she can recall include sumatriptan and naproxen. She has been admitted to the hospital several times recently for panic attacks and suicide attempts. Her temperature is 99.2\u00b0F (37.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 129/65 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient is given dihydroergotamine, IV fluids, and is started on 100% oxygen. Two hours later, the patient demonstrates slurring of her speech. On physical exam there is drooping of the left side of her mouth, and her left upper extremity demonstrates 2/5 strength. A head CT is ordered. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current presentation? (A) Hemorrhagic stroke (B) Ischemic stroke secondary to a thrombus (C) Medication reaction (D) Psychogenic symptoms The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] \n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as slurring of her speech, drooping of the left side of her mouth, and decreased strength in the left upper extremity, are indicative of a focal neurological deficit, specifically hemiparesis. These symptoms, combined with the patient's recent administration of dihydroergotamine, suggest a medication reaction as the most likely cause of her current presentation.\n\nDihydroergotamine is a potent vasoconstrictor and can cause vasospasm, leading to ischemic stroke or cerebral vasospasm. The patient's symptoms of hemiparesis and focal neurological deficits are consistent with a vasospastic event.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n\nA. Hemorrhagic stroke would typically present with a more acute onset and would likely be associated with signs of increased intracranial pressure, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nB. Ischemic stroke secondary to a thrombus would typically present with a more gradual onset and would be more likely to be associated with a history of atherosclerosis or other risk factors for stroke.\n\nD.

The patient has a past medical history of asthma and cocaine use. His current medications include albuterol and ibuprofen. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 70/35 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On initial trauma evaluation, his airway is intact and he is breathing spontaneously. The patient's dorsalis pedis and radial pulses are palpable bilaterally. His Glasgow Coma Scale is 9. Head to toe examination reveals instability of the pelvis when downwards force is applied. The patient is started on IV fluids and norepinephrine, and a pelvic binder is placed. The patient's vitals are measured again and his temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 100/55 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. A blood transfusion is started, and the patient is given hydromorphone. The patient suddenly becomes short of breath with notable bilateral wheezing with poor air movement. His blood pressure is 60/35 mmHg and pulse is 160/min. The patient is treated appropriately, intubated, stabilized, and transferred to the surgical intensive care unit. Which of the following is most likely to be found in this patient's history?

The patient's sudden onset of shortness of breath, bilateral wheezing, and poor air movement, along with hypotension and tachycardia, are consistent with an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction.\n\nA hemolytic transfusion reaction occurs when there is an incompatibility between the blood type of the donor and the recipient, leading to the destruction of red blood cells. This can be due to ABO incompatibility, but it can also be caused by other factors such as Rh incompatibility.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\n(A) Hemolytic anemia and ataxia - This is not directly related to the symptoms presented.\n\n(B) Gum disease and poor wound healing - These are symptoms associated with a deficiency in vitamin C (scurvy), which is not relevant to the patient's current situation.\n\n(C) Irregularly irregular heart rhythm - This is a symptom associated with atrial fibrillation, which is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms.\n\n(D) Anti-A, B, or O antibodies in the serum - This is the most likely answer, as it suggests that the patient has developed antibodies against the ABO blood group, leading to a hemolytic transfusion reaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Anti-A, B, or O antibodies in the serum.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00888", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Although he has had gum bleeding in the past, it has never been this severe. He has no family history available as he was adopted. He does not have any significant past medical history. His physical exam is within normal limits. Screening lab work is ordered with the following values:\nPlatelet count 330,000/mm3\nBleeding time 6 mins\nProthrombin time 12 sec\nActivated partial thromboplastin time 42 sec\nFactor VIII activity decreased\nRistocetin cofactor assay decreased\nHe is subsequently referred to a hematologist for further work-up and treatment.

(A) Gp Ib (B) Factor XI (C) Vitamin K (D) Antithrombin III The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[A]\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest a diagnosis of von Willebrand disease (VWD), an inherited bleeding disorder. VWD is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a protein that plays a critical role in platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites of vascular injury. The ristocetin cofactor assay is a specific test for VWF function, and a decreased result is consistent with VWD. Gp Ib (glycoprotein Ib) is a receptor on platelets that binds to VWF, and its dysfunction would also lead to a similar clinical presentation. \n\nFactor XI (B) is another clotting factor that can cause bleeding disorders, but it would not explain the decreased ristocetin cofactor assay result. Vitamin K (C) is involved in the synthesis of several clotting factors, but its deficiency would not lead to a specific decrease in ristocetin cofactor activity. Antithrombin III (D) is a protein that inhibits thrombin, but its deficiency would lead to a prothrombotic state, not bleeding.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00890", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She drinks alcohol moderately. Her mother had a fracture of the wrist when she was in her late 60s. The physical examination shows no abnormal findings. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA scan) shows a T-score of -3.2 standard deviations (SDs) in the hip. The patient is educated regarding her risk of falls. Exercise regimen and smoking cessation assistance are provided. Appropriate diet is indicated, as well as supplements with calcium and vitamin D.

(A) Alendronate (B) Calcitonin (C) Estrogen (D) Tamoxifen The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[A] \n\nExplanation: The patient has a T-score of -3.2 standard deviations (SDs) in the hip, indicating osteoporosis. The patient's risk factors for osteoporosis include a history of Colles' fracture, a family history of wrist fracture, and smoking. Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that is commonly used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It works by inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, thereby increasing bone density and reducing the risk of fractures.\n\nCalcitonin is another medication used to treat osteoporosis, but it is generally reserved for patients who are unable to tolerate bisphosphonates.\n\nEstrogen is not the best choice for this patient because she is not postmenopausal and estrogen therapy is not typically used for osteoporosis prevention in premenopausal women.\n\nTamoxifen is an estrogen receptor modulator that is used to treat breast cancer, not osteoporosis.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00891", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The contractions last 40 seconds, occur every 2 minutes, and are increasing in intensity. She has a history of recurrent painful ulcers on her vulva, but she currently does not have them. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a non-reassuring fetal heart rate. Her current medications include acyclovir, folic acid, and a multivitamin. Her temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), heart rate is 88/min, and blood pressure is 126/76 mm Hg. Contractions are felt on the abdomen. The cervix is dilated to 5 cm, 70% effaced, and the station of the head is -2. A fetal ultrasound shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? (A) Allow vaginal delivery (B) Initiate misoprostol therapy (C) Initiate nifedipine therapy (D) Perform dilation and evacuation The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B]\n\nExplanation: This patient is experiencing preterm labor, which is defined as labor that begins before 37 weeks of gestation. The patient's current cervical dilation and effacement, along with the contractions, indicate active labor. However, her gestational age of 26 weeks is considered very preterm, and delivery at this time would pose significant risks to the infant, including respiratory distress syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, and other complications.\n\nOption A (Allow vaginal delivery) is incorrect because vaginal delivery at 26 weeks would be extremely risky for the infant.\n\nOption B (Initiate misoprostol therapy) is not the best choice because misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analog that can induce uterine contractions and is often used to induce labor or to treat postpartum hemorrhage. However, its use in very preterm labor is not typically recommended due to the risks of preterm birth complications.\n\nOption D (Perform dilation and evacuation) is not the best choice because dilation and evacuation (D&E) is a procedure used for medical or elective termination of pregnancy, which is not the case here.\n\nOption C (Initiate nifedipine therapy) is the most appropriate next step in management. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that can be used to treat preterm labor by inhibiting uterine contractions. It is often used as a tocolytic agent to delay preterm birth and allow for further evaluation and treatment of the patient and the fetus.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00892", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The patient's exertional dyspnea, dry cough, nocturnal dyspnea, and bilateral pitting edema are consistent with fluid overload and decreased cardiac function.\n\nThe correct answer is associated with the pathophysiology of CHF and fluid overload.\n\n[A] Decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is associated with kidney disease or chronic kidney disease, but it is not directly related to the patient's current condition.\n\n[B] Decreased extracellular fluid (ECF) volume is the opposite of what is expected in CHF, where fluid overload and edema are common.\n\n[C] Increased renal blood flow is not directly associated with the patient's condition. In CHF, renal perfusion is often decreased due to decreased cardiac output.\n\n[D] Increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption is associated with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation, which is a common response to decreased cardiac output and fluid overload in CHF. This leads to increased sodium reabsorption in the kidneys, contributing to fluid retention and edema.\n\nThe correct answer is [D] Increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00893", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The symptoms described in the case, such as pitting edema, abdominal swelling, ascites, and hepatomegaly, are consistent with kwashiorkor. Additionally, the boy's irritability, drowsiness, and difficulty arousing suggest possible liver dysfunction, which is also a common feature of kwashiorkor. The presence of missing teeth is also consistent with kwashiorkor, as it can lead to poor dental health due to inadequate nutrition.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00895", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Since his 18-month visit, the parents have become concerned that his speech does not seem to be developing appropriately. The parents report that the patient\u2019s vocabulary is still limited to fewer than 10 words, and he is still only using single words to describe things. The parents say that his motor milestones do not seem to be affected, as the patient is very physically active and can run and kick a ball. At times the patient seems hyperactive and can be difficult to redirect.

The mother reports that over the past 7 months her son has become increasingly withdrawn; he has not answered any phone calls or visited his family and friends. He had always been a quiet boy, who needed some time on his own, but he used to meet with friends at least once a week. The patient says that he cannot leave the house because aliens are watching him and \u201cstealing his thoughts\u201d. He does not drink alcohol. He used to smoke marijuana occasionally but quit 1 year ago. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, it is impossible to follow the patient's sequence of thoughts. He is anxious and has a flat affect. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Delusional disorder (B) Mood disorder with psychotic features (C) Schizoid personality disorder (D) Schizophrenia The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] \n\nExplanation: \n\nThis patient is presenting with symptoms of a psychotic disorder. The presence of delusions (believing aliens are watching him and stealing his thoughts) and disorganized thinking (impossible to follow his sequence of thoughts) are key indicators of schizophrenia. The duration of symptoms (7 months) also supports a diagnosis of schizophrenia, as it is a chronic condition.\n\nDelusional disorder (A) typically involves a single delusion without other psychotic symptoms, which is not the case here. Mood disorder with psychotic features (B) typically involves a primary mood disorder (depression or mania) with psychotic symptoms, but the patient's primary symptoms are delusions and disorganized thinking, not mood symptoms. Schizoid personality disorder (C) is a personality disorder characterized by a lack of interest in social relationships, which is not the same as the disorganized thinking and delusions seen in this patient.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00897", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She states that she first noticed the swelling 6 weeks ago. Initially, the swelling was minimal, but now she is finding it difficult to walk and she can\u2019t fit into any of her shoes. Her medical history is significant for systemic lupus erythematosus. She takes ibuprofen and hydroxychloroquine. Her temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 153/86 mmHg, and pulse is 88 beats/min. Pitting edema to bilateral knees is noted on physical examination. Urinalysis reveals proteinuria. The patient is started on an immunosuppressant. Two days later the patient returns to clinic complaining of blood in her urine. A urinalysis reveals moderate erythrocytes but is negative for leukocyte esterase, nitrites, or crystals. Diffuse oozing of the bladder mucosa with neovascularization is seen on cystoscopy. Which of the following could have prevented the patient\u2019s condition? (A) Ifosfamide (B) Mesna (C) Methotrexate (D) Nitrofurantoin The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B] \n\nExplanation: The patient's condition is likely a result of hemorrhagic cystitis caused by cyclophosphamide, an immunosuppressant commonly used in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus. This condition is characterized by bleeding from the bladder mucosa and is often associated with the use of certain chemotherapy agents, including cyclophosphamide. \n\nMesna (B) is a protective agent that can prevent hemorrhagic cystitis caused by cyclophosphamide. It works by conjugating with the toxic metabolites of cyclophosphamide, thereby reducing the risk of bladder damage. \n\nIfosfamide (A) is another chemotherapy agent that can cause hemorrhagic cystitis, so it is not a preventive measure. Methotrexate (C) is an immunosuppressant that is not commonly associated with hemorrhagic cystitis. Nitrofurantoin (D) is an antibiotic that can cause hematuria, but it is not typically used to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis caused by cyclophosphamide.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00898", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She is 13 weeks pregnant based on the date of her last menstrual period. She is dizzy and weak, and is unable to move around the house and perform her daily tasks. Initially, she had only light spotting, but later on in the day the bleeding increased. Thus far, she has used six sanitary pads. The blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, the temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), the pulse is 125/min, and the respiratory rate is 14/min. A saline infusion is started, and blood and urine specimens are sent for analysis. On pelvic examination, the vagina contains blood and the cervical os is open. She also complains of cervical motion and adnexal tenderness on examination. An ultrasound shows an intrauterine gestational sac low in the uterine cavity. No fetal movement or cardiac activity are observed. She is advised to rest for a couple of hours, after which the scan is repeated. Slight downward migration of the gestational sac is observed with no change in the fetal status. Which of the following is the next step in management? (A) Antibiotics (B) Magnesium sulfate (C) Methotrexate (D) Dilation and curettage The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] \n\nReasoning: \n\nThis patient is presenting with symptoms of severe vaginal bleeding, dizziness, and weakness, along with a low blood pressure reading. The ultrasound findings of a gestational sac low in the uterine cavity with no fetal movement or cardiac activity are suggestive of an impending or actual spontaneous abortion. The slight downward migration of the gestational sac with no change in the fetal status after rest and repeat ultrasound further supports this diagnosis.\n\nThe next step in management would be dilation and curettage (D&C), which is a procedure to remove the products of conception from the uterus. This is typically done to prevent further bleeding and to reduce the risk of complications such as infection or retained products of conception.\n\nAntibiotics (A) may be considered if there is a suspicion of infection, but the patient's symptoms and ultrasound findings do not suggest this. Magnesium sulfate (B) is used in the management of pre-eclampsia, which is not indicated in this case. Methotrexate (C) is used to treat ectopic pregnancy, but the ultrasound findings in this case are consistent with an intrauterine gestational sac, not an ectopic pregnancy.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00902", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.\nResults: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.\nConclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.\nIf the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify? (A) Measurement bias (B) Recall bias (C) Lead-time bias (D) Selection bias The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[C] Lead-time bias \n\nThis is because the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point-of-care ultrasound could potentially lead to the appearance of improved outcomes, such as lower radiation exposure, without any actual difference in the effectiveness of the treatment. This is an example of lead-time bias, where the earlier detection of a disease leads to a longer apparent survival or better outcomes, but does not necessarily reflect a true improvement in the disease's progression or treatment.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00906", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He is on an experimental drug (drug X) that is used to reduce the action of testosterone by blocking the androgen receptor. Since the initiation of therapy, the growth of the cancerous tissue has slowed. This medication is known to be excreted by the kidneys at the current dose that he is taking. The patient has no significant complaints, except for excessive sweating at times. On physical examination, a small area of tissue around his nipples is enlarged bilaterally. No other abnormal findings are present. Which of the following drugs most likely belongs to be the same class as drug X? (A) Leuprolide (B) Finasteride (C) Flutamide (D) Anastrozole The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[C] \n\nExplanation: \n\nThe patient is on a medication that blocks the androgen receptor to reduce the action of testosterone, which is used to treat prostate cancer. This class of medication is known as anti-androgens. \n\nDrug X is likely an anti-androgen, and among the options given, Flutamide (C) is an anti-androgen that blocks the androgen receptor. It is used in the treatment of prostate cancer and is excreted by the kidneys. \n\nLeuprolide (A) is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, which reduces testosterone production. \n\nFinasteride (B) is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, which reduces the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), but it does not block the androgen receptor. \n\nAnastrozole (D) is an aromatase inhibitor, which reduces estrogen production, primarily used in the treatment of breast cancer.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00930", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

TLS can lead to severe electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and acute kidney injury.\n\nRasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase enzyme that breaks down uric acid into allantoin, which is more soluble and easily excreted by the kidneys. By reducing uric acid levels, rasburicase can help prevent TLS and its associated symptoms.\n\nUrine alkalinization (A) can help prevent uric acid stones by increasing the pH of the urine, but it does not directly address the risk of TLS.\n\nAllopurinol (C) inhibits xanthine oxidase, an enzyme involved in the production of uric acid. However, it does not reduce uric acid levels as quickly as rasburicase and may not be effective in preventing TLS.\n\nIntravenous hydration (D) is an important component of managing TLS, as it helps to flush out the kidneys and prevent the formation of uric acid stones. However, it is not the most effective measure in preventing TLS.\n\nTherefore, the most effective measure in preventing this patient's current symptoms would be rasburicase.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00945", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The pain typically occurs in waves of several individual episodes lasting about one second. It is bilateral, but rarely occurs on both sides simultaneously. Touching her face or brushing her teeth can trigger an attack. Four months ago, she had an episode of weakness in her right arm that lasted for about a week. Family history is notable for migrainous headaches in her mother and brother. Vital signs are within normal limits. There is decreased sensation in the V2 and V3 distribution of her face bilaterally. Muscle strength is 3/5 in the left upper extremity and 5/5 in the right upper extremity. There is spasticity of the lower extremities with sustained clonus. Further evaluation is most likely going to reveal which of the following findings? (A) Multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques (B) Erythematous papules in the V2/V3 nerve distribution (C) Photophobia and phonophobia (D) Rhinorrhea, lacrimination, and ptosis The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B]\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms, including intermittent stabbing face pain, weakness in the right arm, decreased sensation in the V2 and V3 distribution of her face, and spasticity of the lower extremities with sustained clonus, are suggestive of trigeminal neuralgia and multiple sclerosis (MS). Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by sudden, severe, stabbing pain in the face, often triggered by light touch or movement. The patient's family history of migrainous headaches may also suggest a genetic predisposition to MS. The presence of weakness and spasticity, particularly in the lower extremities, is consistent with MS. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it describes multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques, which are characteristic of multiple sclerosis. However, the patient's symptoms and findings do not specifically suggest MS.\n\nOption B is incorrect because erythematous papules in the V2/V3 nerve distribution are more consistent with herpes zoster (shingles) rather than MS.\n\nOption C is incorrect because photophobia and phonophobia are symptoms of migraines, not MS.\n\nOption D is incorrect because rhinorrhea, lacrimination, and ptosis are symptoms of a third cranial nerve palsy, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms and findings.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00957", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She states that her symptoms have progressed and she now feels feverish as well. She also notes an episode of nonbloody diarrhea 2 days ago and has been increasingly nauseous. While being evaluated in the emergency room, she vomits three times. The patient has no significant past medical history but was recently treated with ciprofloxacin for an uncomplicated urinary tract infection. She also notes irregular periods, with a last menstrual period 6 weeks ago. She is a college student who has had 3 sexual partners in the last year with inconsistent use of barrier protection. Her temperature is 100.5\u00b0C (38.1\u00b0F), blood pressure is 102/68 mmHg, pulse is 97/min, and respirations are 14/min. On exam, the patient is noticeably uncomfortable. There is marked tenderness to palpation in the suprapubic region and right lower quadrant, with voluntary guarding but no rebound.

His pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Further evaluation shows a systemic vascular resistance of 35 mm Hg \u00d7 min/L with an end-systolic volume of 80 mL. Which of the following describes the ejection fraction in this patient? (A) 30% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 20% The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo calculate the ejection fraction (EF), we need to know the end-diastolic volume (EDV) and the end-systolic volume (ESV). The formula for EF is:\n\nEF = (EDV - ESV) / EDV \u00d7 100\n\nHowever, the EDV is not given in the problem. But we can calculate the EF using the given information and the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and the pulse (heart rate). \n\nSince the SVR is given, we can use the Frank-Starling mechanism and the relationship between the SVR and the stroke volume to estimate the EF. The relationship between the SVR and the stroke volume is as follows:\n\nStroke volume = (SVR \u00d7 EDV) / (Pulse \u00d7 1332)\n\nHowever, without the EDV, we cannot calculate the exact EF. But we can use the given options and eliminate the ones that are not possible.\n\nThe EF is usually around 50-70% in a healthy adult. An EF of less than 40% is considered reduced. \n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and low blood pressure, we can suspect heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). \n\nOption A (30%) and option D (20%) are both reduced EFs, which is consistent with HFrEF. However, option B (15%) is too low to be a realistic EF value.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA]<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00964", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She complains of vomiting and complete hearing loss in her left ear. The patient believes she had an ear infection in the same ear but never sought out treatment. She has a past medical history of uterine fibroids. She takes mifepristone daily to reduce the size of the fibroids. Her blood pressure is 114/72 mm Hg, the heart rate is 68/min, the respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F). The patient appears pale and in mild distress. Otoscopy reveals a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane. The tympanic membrane is observed to be immobile as confirmed by the pneumatoscope. Pure-tone audiometry testing reveals hearing loss across all frequencies in the left ear. Heart auscultation is without murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Nystagmus is positive to the right. MRI of the brain does not reveal a tumor or abscess. Her physician orders a complete blood count with differential and comprehensive metabolic panel, which show:\nHemoglobin 14.5 gm/dL\nHematocrit 43.2 %\nWhite blood cells 14,500 /mm3\nPlatelets 312,000/mm3\nNeutrophil 81.6%\nLymphocyte 15.2%\nMonocyte 1.4%\nEosinophil 1.2%\nBasophil 0.6%\nSerum Na+ 138 mEq/L\nK+ 4.3 mEq/L\nCl- 108 mmol/L\nBUN 12 mg/dL\nCreatinine 0.8 mg/dL\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient?

The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an infectious process. The most common bacteria causing acute otitis media are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefotaxime is a third-generation cephalosporin that has good coverage against these pathogens, making it an appropriate choice for this patient. Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin with a broader spectrum of activity but is generally used for more severe infections or when resistance patterns are a concern. Amoxicillin is a first-generation cephalosporin that is effective against many pathogens but may not be sufficient for more resistant strains. Cephalexin is a first-generation cephalosporin that is generally used for skin and soft tissue infections.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00965", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Upon initial presentation to the hospital\u2019s emergency department, he was diagnosed with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction and treated with alteplase. He has been under close observation since then. The patient now describes discomfort in his chest and left shoulder, somewhat similar in nature to what initially brought him into the hospital. A pulse of 86/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and a blood pressure of 146/90 mm Hg are observed. Auscultation of the chest reveals no abnormal findings. The patient\u2019s ECG is difficult to interpret. Of the following laboratory tests, an abnormal result of which would have the most diagnostic utility? (A) Alkaline phosphatase (B) Creatine kinase (CK-MB) (C) Lactate dehydrogenase (D) Troponin T The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D]\n\nExplanation: \n\nThis patient initially presented with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was treated with alteplase. However, he now complains of chest pain that is somewhat similar to his initial presentation. The ECG is difficult to interpret, which may indicate re-infarction or re-occlusion of the coronary artery.\n\nTroponin T is a highly specific marker for cardiac damage, and elevated levels are seen in patients with acute myocardial infarction. It remains elevated for a longer period than CK-MB, which is another marker for cardiac damage. If the patient's troponin T levels are elevated, it would indicate re-infarction or re-occlusion of the coronary artery.\n\nAlkaline phosphatase (A) is an enzyme that is elevated in conditions such as bone disease, liver disease, and certain types of cancer, but not specifically in cardiac disease.\n\nCreatine kinase (CK-MB) (B) is a marker for cardiac damage, but it is less specific than troponin T and can be elevated in other conditions such as skeletal muscle damage.\n\nLactate dehydrogenase (C) is an enzyme that is elevated in a variety of conditions, including cardiac disease, but it is not as specific as troponin T for diagnosing cardiac damage.\n\nTherefore, an abnormal result of troponin T (D) would have the most diagnostic utility in this patient.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00967", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She first noticed the lesion 3 days ago. The patient describes the lesion as painful and swollen. She denies vaginal discharge. Her past medical history is notable for mild intermittent asthma, gout, and obesity. She uses an albuterol inhaler as needed and takes allopurinol. She has had 5 sexual partners in the past year and uses the pull-out method for contraception. She has a 10-pack-year smoking history and drinks 10-12 alcoholic beverages per week. On exam, she has an ulcerated, tender, and purulent ulcer on the left labia majora. The patient has mild unilateral painful inguinal lymphadenopathy. This patient's condition is most likely caused by which of the following pathogens?

He noticed that these feelings were more prominent in the last 2 months but have been present on and off for the last year. On many occasions, his mind will be racing with thoughts that keep him up at night. During these moments, he finds his heart racing and feels light-headed and dizzy to the point of blacking out. He has also been experiencing back and neck pain with increased muscle tension in these areas.

(A) Diazepam (B) Ramelteon (C) Buspirone (D) Alprazolam The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[C] \n\nThis patient is presenting with symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), which is characterized by excessive worry, restlessness, and muscle tension. The patient's history of substance abuse is also relevant, as benzodiazepines like diazepam (A) and alprazolam (D) are contraindicated in patients with a history of substance abuse due to the risk of dependence and withdrawal.\n\nBenzodiazepines can be effective for acute anxiety but are not recommended for long-term use due to their potential for dependence and side effects. \n\nRamelteon (B) is used to treat insomnia, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with GAD rather than insomnia.\n\nBuspirone (C) is an anxiolytic medication that is not a benzodiazepine and is not associated with the same risk of dependence as benzodiazepines.

(A) Amnioinfusion (B) Induced vaginal delivery (C) Reassurance (D) Repositioning The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] \n\nExplanation: \n\nGiven the patient's cervical examination showing 100% effacement and 10 cm dilation, it is clear that she is in active labor and making good progress. The cardiotocograph (CTG) is not shown, but it is likely that the tracing is normal or reassuring given that the patient is progressing well in labor.\n\nThe options provided are:\n\nA) Amnioinfusion: This is a procedure where a fluid is infused into the amniotic sac to alleviate variable decelerations on the CTG. However, it is not indicated in this scenario as there is no mention of any abnormalities on the CTG.\n\nB) Induced vaginal delivery: This is not necessary as the patient is already in active labor and making good progress.\n\nC) Reassurance: While reassurance is always important in labor, it is not the most appropriate initial step in management in this scenario.\n\nD) Repositioning: This is the correct answer. Repositioning the patient is often the first step in managing a normal labor, as it can help to improve fetal positioning and alleviate any discomfort or pain. This can also help to promote good uteroplacental perfusion and prevent any potential complications.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate initial step in management is repositioning the patient.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00973", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He says that he used to enjoy playing golf with his friends but now he cannot walk for long enough to play. The shortness of breath is now starting to complicate his ability to get around in daily life. His past medical history is significant for diabetes, hypertension, and early stage prostate cancer that was removed 10 years ago without recurrence. He has smoked 1 pack per day for the past 55 years and drinks about 6 drinks per week. On presentation he is found to be breathing with pursed lips. Physical exam reveals decreased breath sounds on auscultation, increased chest diameter, and hyperresonance to percussion. Which of the following findings would most likely be seen in this patient? (A) Decreased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume (B) Decreased residual volume and increased 1 second forced expiratory volume (C) Increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume (D) Normal residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[C], [D] could be correct but in the context of the patient's symptoms, decreased lung volumes and hyperresonance are suggestive of a condition that causes lung over-expansion. This is most likely seen in a patient with a history of long-term smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). \n\nIn COPD, the airways are narrowed due to chronic inflammation and mucus production, leading to air trapping and lung hyperinflation. This results in increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume (FEV1). The patient's history of smoking, shortness of breath, and decreased breath sounds on auscultation are all consistent with this diagnosis. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is [C] Increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00979", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She has suffered from seasonal allergies for the past 2 years and takes diphenhydramine as needed when her symptoms worsen. She has not yet seen a physician for her allergies. She reports that diphenhydramine has been helpful in controlling her symptoms, but she does not like feeling drowsy from the medication. Her past medical history is also notable for well-controlled asthma. She uses an albuterol inhaler on an as-needed basis. She smokes marijuana daily.

Upon first inspection you note the man is drooling and his eyes are tearing excessively. The patient's wife explains that the man was tilling the fields on the family beet farm when she found him collapsed on a pile of freshly picked beets. The patient seemed confused so the wife brought him in promptly, and states it has only been ten minutes since the patient was found down in the fields. Physical exam is deferred due to a confused and combative patient who is speaking clearly yet his sentences do not make any sense. The patients clothes are removed in the ED.

Organophosphate poisoning can cause an overactivation of acetylcholinesterase, leading to excessive acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, resulting in cholinergic toxicity.\n\nThe initial step in management of organophosphate poisoning involves securing the patient's airway, as the patient's symptoms may progress to respiratory failure. This can be achieved by intubating the patient.\n\nNeostigmine (A) is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and can exacerbate organophosphate poisoning. Physostigmine (B) is also an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and can cross the blood-brain barrier, but its use is not recommended in the initial management of organophosphate poisoning due to the risk of seizures. 2-pralidoxime (C) is an oxime that can re-activate acetylcholinesterase, but its use is not the initial step in management and should be considered after securing the airway.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00985", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He has no complaints other than occasional knee pain. The past medical history includes hypertension. He has had knee osteoarthritis for several years and takes occasional acetaminophen for pain control. His diet is full of vegetables. He exercises every day. He has no history of smoking. He had a brother who died at the age of 84 due to hematologic malignancy. The temperature is 36.8\u2103 (98.2\u2109), and the blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. The physical examination shows no abnormalities other than a reduced range of motion and crepitus in both knees. The laboratory test results are as follows:\nHemoglobin 15 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 58,000/mm3\nPlatelet count 250,000/mm3\nFlow cytometry on the peripheral blood reveals an absolute lymphocyte count of 50,000/mm3. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (B) Monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL) (C) Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) (D) Multiple myeloma (MM) The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] Multiple myeloma (MM) is less likely due to the absence of specific findings such as hypercalcemia, anemia, kidney dysfunction, or lytic bone lesions in the history and physical examination. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) typically presents with a monoclonal spike on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), which is not mentioned in the question stem.\n\nBetween CLL and MBL, CLL is more likely to be the diagnosis given the significantly elevated leukocyte count of 58,000/mm3. CLL often presents with lymphocytosis in the peripheral blood and an absolute lymphocyte count of 5,000 cells/\u03bcL or higher. The flow cytometry on the peripheral blood reveals an absolute lymphocyte count of 50,000/mm3, which is consistent with CLL. MBL typically presents with a lower absolute lymphocyte count (less than 5,000 cells/\u03bcL) and a less severe clinical course.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00986", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

However, given the long-standing nature of her symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO). \n\nThe correct answer is [C] Increased serotonin production, as increased serotonin production is associated with the most likely diagnosis of Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO). This is because bacteria in the small intestine can break down tryptophan into serotonin, leading to increased levels of serotonin in the body. The increased serotonin levels can contribute to symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel habits.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00990", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The patient was born at term and had his first bowel movement at 50 hours of life. He has since had one bowel movement daily. He is at the 50th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 40th percentile for head circumference. He does not appear to be in acute distress. His temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows that the patient has small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The abdomen is distended. When the finger is removed following a rectal exam, there is an explosive release of stool from the patient's rectum.

Key features include:\n\n1. Unresponsiveness to voice and touch but a flexor response to pain, which suggests a decreased level of consciousness but preserved spinal cord function.\n2. Constricted pupils (miosis) are a classic sign of opioid overdose.\n3. Shallow breathing is also consistent with opioid overdose, as opioids can cause respiratory depression.\n4. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a low pH (acidosis) and an elevated Pco2 (hypercapnia), which indicates respiratory acidosis. This is consistent with opioid-induced respiratory depression.\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis (A) would typically present with a higher anion gap (not provided in the ABG), and the patient's pH and Pco2 would be more consistent with a metabolic acidosis.\n\nDiuretic overdose (B) would not typically cause respiratory depression or constricted pupils.\n\nHyperventilation (C) would cause a decrease in Pco2, not an increase.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-00998", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

His cough has been increasing in frequency and severity over the course of 3 days, and his sputum production has increased in volume. The color of his sputum is yellow-green. He denies any chest pain or palpitations but has experienced worsening shortness of breath with exertion and at rest, which is above his baseline. He has not noticed any changes in his weight or edema in his lower extremities. He denies any recent history of long travel. Medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has been hospitalized four times for similar symptoms within the last year. He has smoked approximately 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 45 years. His temperature is 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/94 mmHg, pulse is 101/min, and respirations are 26/min with an oxygen saturation of 85% on room air. On physical exam, the patient has difficulty speaking, and there is asynchronous motion between the chest and abdomen with respiration. Wheezing is appreciated on pulmonary auscultation. An ECG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm. A chest radiograph is obtained, and he is administered supplemental oxygen. He is started on ipratropium, albuterol, and methylprednisolone.

(A) Cefazolin (B) Ceftriaxone (C) Levofloxacin (D) Penicillin The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B] \n\nThis patient is likely experiencing a severe exacerbation of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is complicated by a bacterial infection. The yellow-green sputum production and asynchronous motion between the chest and abdomen with respiration (indicative of use of accessory muscles) are suggestive of a bacterial infection. The patient's fever (102\u00b0F) and elevated white blood cell count (not provided) further support this diagnosis. \n\nCeftriaxone is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including those commonly responsible for respiratory infections in patients with COPD. It is typically administered intravenously and can be used in combination with other antibiotics or as a monotherapy.\n\nCefazolin (A) is a first-generation cephalosporin with limited activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a common pathogen in COPD exacerbations. \n\nLevofloxacin (C) is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is effective against a broad range of bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, its use is generally reserved for patients who have failed first-line therapy or have a history of severe COPD exacerbations.\n\nPenicillin (D) is not typically used to treat COPD exacerbations due to its limited activity against the common pathogens responsible for these infections.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is [B].<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01005", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She has no complaints during this visit but her daughter states that she is having difficulty locating objects such as the television remote, car keys, and her purse. Her medical history is significant for Alzheimer\u2019s dementia, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure, osteoarthritis and centrilobular emphysema. The patient takes memantine, atorvastatin, metformin, levothyroxine, lisinopril, aspirin, albuterol, and ipratropium. The patient\u2019s vitals are within normal limits today. Physical exam reveals an elderly female in no acute distress, oriented to person, place and year, but not to month or day of the week. She has a 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border along with an S3 gallop. There are mild crackles at the lung bases. The remainder of the exam is normal.

Given her history of Alzheimer's dementia, which may affect her ability to complete a full void, and the presence of a holosystolic murmur and S3 gallop, suggesting possible heart failure, which may lead to urinary retention, it would be beneficial to consider a medication that can be taken less frequently and is effective against gram-negative organisms, which are common causes of UTIs. \n\nLevofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is effective against gram-negative bacteria and can be taken once daily, making it a good option for this patient. TMP-SMX (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is a common choice for UTIs, but it is not indicated in this patient as the previous urine culture showed growth of Enterobacter, which is resistant to TMP-SMX. Nitrofurantoin is typically used for lower urinary tract infections and is not indicated in this case as the patient has a history of Enterobacter, which is a gram-negative organism. No treatment is not necessary as the patient has a history of recurrent UTIs and the current urinalysis results are positive for leukocyte esterase, nitrites, and WBCs.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01009", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

This type of anemia is often caused by a deficiency in either vitamin B12 or folate. The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and the use of a new medication could be a clue to the diagnosis. Methotrexate, a medication used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, is a folate antagonist and can cause megaloblastic anemia.

They state that their daughter has recently been more irritable than usual, and she occasionally becomes pale and blue. Her parents note that she was diagnosed with a heart murmur, but it was never treated. Physical examination reveals a small child in distress. She is laying on the examination table with her knees drawn to her chest. Cardiac auscultation reveals a harsh, systolic ejection murmur that is best heard at the upper left sternal border. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Tetralogy of Fallot (B) Transposition of great vessels (C) Pulmonary hypoplasia (D) Atrial septal defect The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[A] Tetralogy of Fallot.\n\nReasoning: The symptoms and physical examination findings described are consistent with Tetralogy of Fallot, a congenital heart defect characterized by four main features:\n\n1. Ventricular septal defect (VSD)\n2. Pulmonary stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonary valve)\n3. Right ventricular hypertrophy (thickening of the right ventricle)\n4. Overriding aorta (the aorta is positioned over the VSD)\n\nThe harsh, systolic ejection murmur heard at the upper left sternal border is consistent with pulmonary stenosis. The child's irritability, pallor, and cyanosis (blue discoloration) are also typical of Tetralogy of Fallot, as they indicate decreased oxygenation of the blood. The child's position on the examination table, with knees drawn to her chest, is also consistent with Tetralogy of Fallot, as children with this condition often adopt a \"sitting up\" position to improve oxygenation.\n\nThe other options are not as consistent with the described symptoms and physical examination findings:\n\n* Transposition of great vessels (option B) would typically present with severe cyanosis and respiratory distress from birth, rather than a gradual onset of symptoms.\n* Pulmonary hypoplasia (option C) refers to underdevelopment of the lungs, which may not directly cause the described symptoms.\n* Atrial septal defect (option D) is a different type of congenital heart defect that typically presents with a different type of murmur and may not cause the same level of cyanosis.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01016", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The patient was an unrestrained passenger in a motor vehicle crash and was ejected from the vehicle after collision. Upon arrival to the trauma bay, the patient has a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 6. He is rapidly intubated, and vitals are a temperature of 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), pulse of 130 bpm, and blood pressure of 83/64 mmHg. He is noted to have multiple ecchymoses over his body, as well as petechiae and purpura. He has a laceration over his clavicle that continues to bleed despite a pressure bandage. Radiographs of his lower extremity show multiple long bone fractures. Two large bore IV lines are placed, and the patient oozes from around the sites of venepuncture. Labs are notable for a WBC of 20,000/mm^3, Hb of 10.1g/dL, platelets of 48,000/mm^3, and prolongation of the PT and aPTT. This patient's presentation can best be explained by which of the following diagnoses? (A) Air embolization (B) Tension pneumothorax (C) Disseminated intravascular coagulation (D) Coagulopathy of trauma The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] \n\nThis patient's presentation is most consistent with coagulopathy of trauma, also known as traumatic coagulopathy or acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC). The patient has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 6, indicating severe head injury, and multiple long bone fractures, suggesting significant trauma. The patient's laboratory results show thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), prolongation of PT and aPTT, and a high WBC count, which are all consistent with ATC. Additionally, the patient's bleeding from multiple sites, including the IV lines and the laceration over the clavicle, further supports this diagnosis. \n\nWhile air embolization and tension pneumothorax are potential complications of trauma, they are not directly related to the patient's laboratory results or clinical presentation. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a possible complication of trauma, but the patient's presentation is more consistent with ATC.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01017", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

(A) Alcohol (B) Cocaine (C) Diphenhydramine (D) Haloperidol The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D]\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms, including agitation, aggression, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, and mydriasis (7 mm pupils) are consistent with a sympathomimetic toxidrome, which is often seen in cocaine overdose. Additionally, the patient's history of schizophrenia and recent office note for treatment of seasonal allergies (which may include diphenhydramine) do not align with the patient's current presentation. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine, would more likely cause anticholinergic toxidrome symptoms such as dilated pupils, dry skin, and altered mental status, which are not present in this patient. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic, and while it may be used to treat agitation, it is not likely to cause the patient's current symptoms.

This accumulation occurs due to the breakdown of red blood cells, which is common in congestive heart failure. \n\nThe significance of lysosomes in this process lies in their ability to fuse with phagosomes containing the ingested red blood cells and their hemoglobin content. Lysosomes then break down the hemoglobin into smaller components, including hemosiderin, which is then stored within the macrophage. \n\nTherefore, the cellular organelle significant in the formation of heart failure cells is lysosomes.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01025", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Always answer in the form of [A], [B], [C], or [D].<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nA 35-year-old man comes to the emergency department with acute shortness of breath that developed after a 10-hour international flight. His pulse is 124/min and pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 90%. He weighs 50-kg (110-lb). A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is suspected and intravenous heparin is initiated. If the volume of distribution of heparin is equivalent to 60 mL/kg and the target peak plasma concentration is 0.5 units/mL, which of the following is the most appropriate loading dose for this patient? (A) 3,000 units (B) 1,500 units (C) 6,000 units (D) Cannot be calculated, as bioavailability is not known The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo calculate the loading dose, we first need to find the total volume of distribution. Given that the volume of distribution of heparin is equivalent to 60 mL/kg and the patient weighs 50 kg, we can calculate the total volume of distribution as follows:\n\nVolume of distribution = 60 mL/kg * 50 kg = 3000 mL or 3 L\n\nThe target peak plasma concentration is 0.5 units/mL, and we want to find the loading dose that will achieve this concentration in the patient's total volume of distribution. We can use the formula:\n\nLoading dose = Peak plasma concentration * Volume of distribution\n\nLoading dose = 0.5 units/mL * 3 L = 1.5 L * 1000 mL/L = 1500 mL * 1000 units/L = 1,500,000 units \n\nHowever, the unit for heparin is usually expressed in units (U) rather than units per mL, so we can divide the volume of the dose by the volume of distribution to get the dose in units. \n\nHowever, to make the calculation more straightforward, we can convert units to mL. Since 1 L = 1000 mL, we can multiply 3 L by 1000 mL/L to get 3000 mL. We then multiply 0.5 units/mL by 3000 mL to get 1500 units.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate loading dose for this patient is (B) 1,500 units.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01028", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

(A) Medial aspect of the upper arm (B) Lateral aspect of the shoulder (C) Skin above the clavicle (D) Dorsal aspect of forearm and hand The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe answer is (D) Dorsal aspect of forearm and hand.\n\nThe symptoms described suggest a shoulder dislocation, specifically an anterior dislocation of the shoulder. The loss of normal rounded appearance of the shoulder and the palpation of the humeral head below the coracoid process are indicative of this type of injury.\n\nThe brachial plexus, which is the collection of nerves that supply the arm, is commonly injured in shoulder dislocations. The brachial plexus is formed by the C5-T1 spinal nerves and gives rise to several branches that innervate the arm.\n\nThe dorsal aspect of the forearm and hand is innervated by the C6 and C7 spinal nerves, which are part of the brachial plexus. Damage to the brachial plexus in a shoulder dislocation can lead to reduced sensation in the areas innervated by these nerves.\n\nTherefore, the most likely area of reduced sensation in this patient is the dorsal aspect of the forearm and hand.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01037", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

His blood pressure is 157/90 mmHg and his his pulse is 116/min. He appears anxious and agitated and a careful exam reveals dilated pupils and a perforated nasal septum. An EKG reveals ST segment elevation so he is urgently taken for cardiac intervention. Upon review, this patient reveals that he has not had care from a physician since he graduated from college. In the interim he has been largely unemployed and admits that he has recently been homeless. When asked directly, the patient admits to alcohol and marijuana use but denies illicit drug use. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the agent most likely responsible for this patient's presentation? (A) Blocking reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine (B) Inhibiting breakdown of biogenic amines (C) Antagonizing the NMDA receptor (D) Inhibiting the GABA receptor The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D]\n\nExplanation: The patient's presentation, including dilated pupils, agitation, and nasal septum perforation, is suggestive of chronic cocaine use. Cocaine is a potent stimulant that acts by inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. However, the specific symptoms mentioned are more closely associated with chronic cocaine use. The most likely mechanism of action of the agent responsible for this patient's presentation is inhibiting the GABA receptor, which would explain the agitation and anxiety. However, this is a bit misleading because the primary issue here is cocaine use.\n\nCocaine acts by blocking the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin (A), but this does not fully explain the patient's presentation. Cocaine also has a local anesthetic effect, which could explain the nasal septum perforation (B), but this is not the primary issue here. Cocaine does not inhibit the breakdown of biogenic amines (C), and it does not antagonize the NMDA receptor (D). \n\nHowever, when we consider the specific options, the correct answer would be [D] inhibiting the GABA receptor, as this would explain the patient's agitation and anxiety, but keep in mind that this is a bit misleading as the primary issue here is cocaine use.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01039", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

This is because the body's immune response to parasitic infections, such as pinworms, often involves the activation of TH2 cells. These cells are involved in the production of IgE antibodies and eosinophils, which are essential components of the immune response to parasitic infections.\n\nTherefore, the na\u00efve T cells (TH0) have developed into TH2 cells due to the infection in this patient.\n\nThe correct answer is: [B]<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01045", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

A representative sample of 100 men shows a normal distribution of hemoglobin concentration with a mean concentration of 17 g/dL and a standard error of 0.1 g/dL. Which of the following best represents the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL? (A) 30% (B) 15% (C) 95% (D) 99% The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the z-score corresponding to a hemoglobin concentration of 18 g/dL, and then use a standard normal distribution (z-table) to find the probability.\n\nFirst, we calculate the z-score:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere X is the value of interest (18 g/dL), \u03bc is the mean (17 g/dL), and \u03c3 is the standard error (0.1 g/dL).\n\nz = (18 - 17) / 0.1\nz = 1 / 0.1\nz = 10\n\nHowever, the z-score of 10 is extremely high and is out of the range of the standard normal distribution table. This indicates that the calculated z-score is not accurate.\n\nThe correct approach is to calculate the z-score as follows:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / (\u03c3 * \u221an)\n\nwhere n is the sample size (100).\n\nz = (18 - 17) / (0.1 * \u221a100)\nz = 1 / 0.1\nz = 10 is still out of the range of the standard normal distribution table.\n\nHowever, using the correct formula for the standard error of the mean (SEM), we can calculate the z-score as follows:\n\nSEM = \u03c3 / \u221an\n= 0.1 / \u221a100\n= 0.1 / 10\n= 0.01\n\nNow, we can calculate the z-score:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / SEM\n= (18 - 17) / 0.01\n= 1 / 0.01\n= 100\n\nHowever, the z-score of 100 is still out of the range of the standard normal distribution table.\n\nGiven that the calculated z-score is not accurate, let's consider the correct approach to solve this problem.\n\nTo find the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL, we can use the z-table or a calculator to find the area to the right of the z-score.\n\nHowever, since the z-score is extremely high, we can use a different approach. \n\nGiven that the mean hemoglobin concentration is 17 g/dL and the standard error is 0.1 g/dL, the range of hemoglobin concentrations that are 2 standard errors away from the mean (i.e., 2 * 0.1 ="}, {"id": "test-01047", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

This novel drug has the property where its clearance is relatively predictable based on patient demographics and can easily be extrapolated from other data. Its metabolism and volume of distribution also do not change dramatically from patient to patient. The investigator wants to make sure that the plasma concentration of the drug in this patient is 15 mg/L and he knows the following drug characteristics.\n\nBioavailability: 50%\nDrug half-life: 2 hours\nVolume of distribution: 14.3 liters\n\nWhich of the following represents the maintenance dose that should be given to this patient every 8 hours? (A) 150 milligrams (B) 430 milligrams (C) 1200 milligrams (D) 3600 milligrams The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the clearance (CL) of the drug first.\n\nWe can use the formula:\n\nClearance (CL) = (Volume of distribution (Vd) x Bioavailability (F)) / Half-life (t1/2)\n\nGiven values are:\n- Vd = 14.3 liters\n- F = 50% or 0.5\n- t1/2 = 2 hours\n\nWe need to convert the half-life to the same time unit as the dosing interval, which is 8 hours. Since 2 hours is half of 4 hours, the half-life is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 2/4 = 0.5 dosing intervals.\n\nHowever, for the formula, we can use the half-life as it is because the clearance is independent of the dosing interval.\n\nClearance (CL) = (14.3 x 0.5) / 2\nCL = 7.15 L/hour\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the maintenance dose (MD):\n\nMD = Desired plasma concentration (Cp) x Clearance (CL) x Dosing interval (\u03c4)\n\nGiven values are:\n- Cp = 15 mg/L\n- CL = 7.15 L/hour\n- \u03c4 = 8 hours\n\nMD = 15 x 7.15 x 8\nMD = 1026 milligrams\n\nHowever, this dose is for a single dosing interval. Since the question asks for the dose given every 8 hours, we need to multiply this dose by 3 (since there are 3 dosing intervals in 24 hours).\n\nMD = 1026 x 3\nMD = 3078 milligrams\n\nRounding this to the nearest answer choice, we get 3600 milligrams.\n\nThe answer is [D].<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01052", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Mom had no prenatal care, has no medical issues, and is unvaccinated. The baby had been breastfeeding well until 24 hours ago when mom noticed he started having trouble latching. In the last 12 hours, he has completely refused to feed. He has had a decreased number of wet diapers and has stooled twice in the last 24 hours. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37.0\u00b0C), pulse is 180/min, respirations are 52/min, and blood pressure is 70/50 mmHg.

Her blood pressure is 120/88 mm Hg, pulse is 78/min, temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), and respiratory rate is 16/min. Laboratory findings are unremarkable, except for a potassium level of 3.3 mmol/L and serum calcium of 11 mg/dL. The attending physician suspects that this might be a case of a genetic mutation in the menin 1 gene on chromosome 11 and orders a genetic analysis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? (A) Vibrio cholera infection (B) VIPoma (C) Rotavirus (D) Campylobacter jejuni The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B] \n\nReasoning: \n\nThe patient presents with symptoms of chronic diarrhea, facial flushing, and weakness. The laboratory findings show hypercalcemia (elevated serum calcium) and hypokalemia (low potassium level), which are suggestive of a paraneoplastic syndrome. The attending physician suspects a genetic mutation in the menin 1 gene, which is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome. MEN1 syndrome is characterized by the occurrence of tumors in multiple endocrine glands, including the parathyroid glands, pancreas, and pituitary gland. \n\nThe most likely diagnosis in this patient is a parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia, which is a common feature of MEN1 syndrome. The parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone (PTH), which regulates calcium levels in the blood. Elevated PTH levels can lead to hypercalcemia, which is consistent with the patient's laboratory findings. \n\nVibrio cholera infection (A) is a cause of acute diarrhea, but it would not explain the patient's chronic symptoms or the laboratory findings. VIPoma (B) is a type of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor that can cause watery diarrhea, but it would not explain the patient's hypercalcemia or the suspected genetic mutation.

The patient was helping his son move this past weekend, and he noticed after the move that he had pain and weakness in his right shoulder. The patient thought that this pain was just him being in poor shape so he started going to the gym and lifting weights which made his symptoms significantly worse. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, obesity, and asthma. His current medications include albuterol, lisinopril, metformin, and glipizide. On physical exam you note an obese gentleman who seems to be in pain. You note prominent weakness of external rotation of his right upper extremity. When you ask the patient to slowly lower his right arm to his side when he holds it overhead, you note that he suddenly drops his arm and appears to be in pain. The patient's strength is 1/5 for abduction of the right arm. Which of the following is most likely injured in this patient? (A) Supraspinatus (B) Infraspinatus (C) Teres minor (D) Deltoid The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B]\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a rotator cuff injury, specifically a supraspinatus tendon injury is less likely because it's typically associated with weakness of abduction at 0 degrees, not 90 degrees. \n\nThe patient's sudden drop of his arm when lowering it from an overhead position is a classic sign of a rotator cuff injury, specifically an infraspinatus or teres minor injury, as these muscles are responsible for external rotation of the arm. The infraspinatus muscle is primarily responsible for external rotation at 90 degrees of abduction, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms.\n\nThe patient's weakness of external rotation (1/5 strength) is also consistent with an infraspinatus or teres minor injury. The deltoid muscle is responsible for abduction of the arm, not external rotation, so it is less likely to be the injured muscle.\n\nTherefore, the most likely injured muscle in this patient is the infraspinatus.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01055", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Auscultation of the lungs shows coarse crackles at the right upper posterior field. An x-ray of the chest shows an opacity in the right upper lobe. Sputum analysis shows acid-fast bacilli. A small amount of tuberculin fluid is injected into the subcutaneous tissue on the left forearm. Examination of the injected area 48 hours later shows no induration or erythema. Impairment of which of the following processes is the most likely cause of the negative tuberculin skin test seen in this patient? (A) Interaction of B7 and CD28 ligands (B) Opsonization by complement proteins (C) Secretion of interleukin-4 (D) Generation of reactive oxygen species The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[A]\n\nExplanation: The patient's negative tuberculin skin test is indicative of anergy, which is a condition of impaired cellular immunity. In anergy, the T cells are unable to respond to antigens, such as the tuberculin. The interaction of B7 and CD28 ligands is crucial for T cell activation. B7 molecules on the antigen-presenting cells interact with CD28 receptors on the T cells, leading to T cell activation and proliferation. In patients with anergy, such as those with advanced HIV infection, the interaction of B7 and CD28 ligands is impaired, leading to a negative tuberculin skin test. \n\nOpsonization by complement proteins (B) is involved in the innate immune response and helps to mark pathogens for destruction by phagocytes. Secretion of interleukin-4 (C) is involved in the Th2 response, which is not directly related to the tuberculin skin test. Generation of reactive oxygen species (D) is a mechanism used by phagocytes to kill ingested pathogens.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01058", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The low blood pressure in this context is likely due to septic shock, which can be caused by bacterial meningitis. \n\nAdrenocortical insufficiency, or Addison's disease, is a condition where the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol and aldosterone. It can lead to hypotension (low blood pressure) in response to stress, such as infection. \n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is not directly related to the patient's low blood pressure in this scenario.\n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a condition where the heart muscle becomes thickened, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and low blood pressure. However, this is not directly related to the patient's symptoms of meningitis.\n\nPheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal glands that can cause hypertension (high blood pressure), not hypotension (low blood pressure).<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01059", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

She is accompanied by her sister who says that her symptoms developed acutely and is unsure about what caused it. She is currently on methimazole, which she last took approximately 1 week ago. Approximately 5 days ago she developed an upper respiratory infection managed with bed rest and ibuprofen. Her temperature is 105\u00b0F (40.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 95/68 mmHg, pulse is 145/min, and respirations are 23/min. On physical examination, the patient has altered mentation and is agitated and diaphoretic. The patient also has a goiter, exophthalmos, warm skin, and a hand tremor. She is started on intravenous fluids. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient? (A) Antibiotics (B) Carotid massage (C) Clonazepam (D) Propranolol The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D]\n\nExplanation: The patient is presenting with symptoms of a thyroid storm, a life-threatening complication of untreated or inadequately treated hyperthyroidism. The patient's symptoms, including fever, tachycardia, agitation, and diaphoresis, are consistent with this diagnosis. The presence of a goiter and exophthalmos also supports the diagnosis of Graves' disease, a common cause of hyperthyroidism.\n\nThe best treatment option for this patient is propranolol, a beta-blocker that can help to control the symptoms of thyroid storm by blocking the effects of excess thyroid hormone on the body. Propranolol can help to reduce the patient's heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature, and can also help to alleviate symptoms of anxiety and agitation.\n\nAntibiotics (A) are not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of a bacterial infection.\n\nCarotid massage (B) is a treatment option for thyroid storm, but it is not the best initial treatment. Carotid massage can help to reduce the production of thyroid hormones by compressing the thyroid gland, but it is typically used in conjunction with other treatments, such as propranolol and hydrocortisone.\n\nClonazepam (C) is a benzodiazepine that can help to alleviate symptoms of anxiety and agitation, but it is not the best treatment option for thyroid storm.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01062", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

On presentation, he is found to be confused and very lethargic. His parents said that he has had a fever and cough for several days prior to presentation and was given an over the counter medication. Physical exam of this patient reveals mild hepatomegaly and dry mucous membranes. Which of the following effects would the drug most likely also have on the nephron? (A) Constriction of afferent arteriole and no effect on efferent arteriole (B) Dilation of afferent arteriole and no effect on efferent arteriole (C) No effect on afferent arteriole and constriction of efferent arteriole (D) No effect on afferent arteriole and dilation of efferent arteriole The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the symptoms described, the most likely cause of the boy's condition is acetaminophen (Tylenol) overdose. The symptoms of vomiting, lethargy, confusion, and hepatomegaly are consistent with acetaminophen toxicity, which can cause liver damage.\n\nAcetaminophen is primarily metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys. In the kidneys, it is primarily excreted through the glomeruli. However, the question asks about the effect on the nephron.\n\nThe nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, and it consists of the glomerulus and the renal tubules. The glomerulus is responsible for filtering waste and excess fluids from the blood, and it is controlled by the afferent and efferent arterioles.\n\nIn the context of acetaminophen toxicity, the kidneys are affected, but the specific effect on the nephron is not directly stated in the question. However, based on the options provided, we can analyze the effects of various substances on the nephron.\n\nOption (A) constriction of the afferent arteriole and no effect on the efferent arteriole would decrease the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and increase the pressure in the glomerulus, which is not typical of acetaminophen toxicity.\n\nOption (B) dilation of the afferent arteriole and no effect on the efferent arteriole would increase the GFR and decrease the pressure in the glomerulus, which is also not typical of acetaminophen toxicity.\n\nOption (C) no effect on the afferent arteriole and constriction of the efferent arteriole would decrease the GFR and increase the pressure in the glomerulus, which is consistent with the effects of acetaminophen toxicity on the kidneys.\n\nOption (D) no effect on the afferent arteriole and dilation of the efferent arteriole would increase the GFR and decrease the pressure in the glomerulus, which is not typical of acetaminophen toxicity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[C]<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01063", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

They are usually benign but can be malignant or borderline. The biopsy results in this case show hyperplasia and atypia, which are more consistent with a phyllodes tumor than the other options.\n\nFibroadenoma (B) is a benign breast tumor, but it is typically composed of glandular and fibrous tissue and does not show papillary projections or hyperplasia and atypia.\n\nFibrocystic disease of the breast (C) is a common condition that causes lumpy or rope-like breast tissue, but it does not form a distinct mass or show papillary projections or hyperplasia and atypia on biopsy.\n\nInvasive lobular carcinoma (D) is a type of breast cancer, but it typically shows a more infiltrative or diffuse growth pattern rather than the papillary projections seen in this case.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n[A] Phyllodes tumor.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01070", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

GBS is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral nerves, leading to muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing elevated protein concentration and normal leukocyte count further supports this diagnosis.\n\nTreatment for GBS typically involves supportive care, such as mechanical ventilation if necessary, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasma exchange to reduce the severity and duration of the disease. Prednisone is sometimes used but is generally less effective than IVIG in treating GBS.\n\nBotulism antitoxin is used to treat botulism, a different condition that also presents with muscle weakness, but is caused by a toxin produced by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum.\n\nGabapentin is an anticonvulsant medication used to treat seizures and neuropathic pain, and is not indicated in the treatment of GBS.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01072", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The patient's history of chronic back pain and the absence of other potential causes for his symptoms suggest that he may be experiencing withdrawal from opioids. \n\nNaltrexone is an opioid antagonist that can be used to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms. It works by blocking the effects of opioids at the opioid receptor, which can help to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that can be used to manage anxiety and agitation associated with opioid withdrawal, but it does not address the underlying opioid withdrawal symptoms. Methadone is a long-acting opioid agonist that is often used in the treatment of opioid addiction, but it is not typically used to manage acute withdrawal symptoms. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that can be used to reverse opioid overdose, but it is not typically used to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is naltrexone.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01075", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The diplopia is more prominent on his left-side lateral gaze. He denies having fever, headache, ocular pain, lacrimation, changes in color vision, or limb weakness. He has a past medical history of type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and ischemic heart disease. In addition, he had an ischemic stroke 9 years ago, from which he recovered completely with physiotherapy and rehabilitation. He has a history of a 56-pack-year cigarette smoking habit. His medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, glimepiride, metformin, metoprolol, and ramipril. The mental status examination is unremarkable. His muscle strength is normal in all 4 limbs. His sensations are decreased on his left side, including his face. The examination of extraocular movements is shown in the image. A lesion in which of the following locations explains the findings during eye examination? (A) Cavernous sinus (B) Corticospinal tract before pyramidal decussation (C) Frontal eye field (D) Medial longitudinal fasciculus The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo answer this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario:\n\n1. The patient has left-sided numbness, diplopia (double vision), and blurring of vision, with diplopia more prominent on left-side lateral gaze.\n2. The patient has a history of ischemic stroke, but it was 9 years ago and he recovered completely.\n3. The patient has normal muscle strength and sensations are decreased on his left side, including his face.\n4. The examination of extraocular movements is abnormal, but the specific findings are not described.\n\nGiven these points, the most likely explanation for the findings is a lesion affecting the cranial nerves or their nuclei that control eye movements.\n\nThe options can be evaluated as follows:\n\nA. Cavernous sinus: A lesion in the cavernous sinus would affect the oculomotor nerve (CN III), trochlear nerve (CN IV), ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve (V1), and the abducens nerve (CN VI). This would likely cause ptosis, diplopia, and decreased sensation on the face, which matches the patient's symptoms.\n\nB. Corticospinal tract before pyramidal decussation: A lesion in the corticospinal tract before pyramidal decussation would affect the motor function of the left side of the body, but it would not explain the diplopia or decreased sensation on the face.\n\nC. Frontal eye field: The frontal eye field is responsible for voluntary eye movements, but a lesion in this area would not explain the decreased sensation on the face or the specific pattern of diplopia.\n\nD. Medial longitudinal fasciculus: The medial longitudinal fasciculus is a bundle of nerve fibers that connects the nuclei of the cranial nerves that control eye movements. While a lesion in this area could cause eye movement abnormalities, it would not explain the decreased sensation on the face.\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely location of the lesion is the cavernous sinus, which would explain the patient's symptoms of diplopia, decreased sensation on the face, and the abnormal examination of extraocular movements.\n\nThe answer is A.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01080", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The drug administered to this patient is likely epinephrine (adrenaline), which is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis.\n\nEpinephrine acts on cardiac pacemaker cells by increasing the rate of depolarization, which is mediated by the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels. This effect is primarily due to the inhibition of potassium efflux during phase 3 of the action potential, which is known as the repolarization phase. As a result, the action potential is prolonged, leading to an increase in the heart rate.\n\nThe other options are not accurate:\n\nA. Increased Ca2+ influx in phase 4 is not a characteristic effect of epinephrine on cardiac pacemaker cells.\n\nB.

He was born to a 33-year-old woman at 31 weeks gestation via cesarean section. His birth weight was 1400 grams. Vital signs are significant for systemic hypotension, bradycardia, and hypoventilation. On physical exam, the patient has an altered level of consciousness with decreased spontaneous and elicited movements. The patient is hypotonic on motor testing, has bulging anterior fontanelle, and appears cyanotic. Which of the following is the best next step in management? (A) Complete blood count (B) Cranial ultrasonography (C) Head CT (D) MRI of the head The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B] \n\nThe clinical presentation of this 3-day-old premature boy with seizures, systemic hypotension, bradycardia, hypoventilation, altered level of consciousness, decreased spontaneous and elicited movements, hypotonia, bulging anterior fontanelle, and cyanosis is highly suggestive of a condition known as intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), which is a common complication in preterm infants. \n\nGiven the clinical suspicion of IVH, the best next step in management would be to perform cranial ultrasonography, which is a non-invasive imaging technique that can provide real-time images of the brain and detect IVH. Cranial ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality in the neonatal period due to its safety, availability, and ability to detect IVH at an early stage. \n\nWhile head CT and MRI of the head can also be used to diagnose IVH, they are not the preferred initial imaging modalities in the neonatal period due to their higher radiation exposure and limited availability.

He says that he has felt increasing shortness of breath while exercising over the past 6 months. He is a well-built man in mild distress. The vital signs include heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 18/min, temperature 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F), and blood pressure 135/90 mm Hg. The cardiac examination is significant for a harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border which is accentuated by forceful expiration against a closed airway. Palpation of the carotid artery shows 2 closely spaced pulses which occur during systole. Which of the following is most consistent with these findings? (A) Aortic stenosis (B) Cardiac tamponade (C) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (D) Third-degree heart block The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[C] \n\nExplanation: The key findings in this case are the harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border, which is accentuated by forceful expiration against a closed airway, and the 2 closely spaced pulses (double impulse) in the carotid artery. These findings are classic for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The murmur is due to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, which is exacerbated by maneuvers that increase left ventricular contractility and afterload. The double impulse in the carotid pulse is due to the rapid contraction of the left ventricle, which is a hallmark of HCM.\n\nAortic stenosis (A) typically presents with a systolic ejection murmur, but it is usually a crescendo-decrescendo murmur, not a harsh systolic ejection murmur. Cardiac tamponade (B) would present with hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and possibly pulsus paradoxus, which is not seen in this case. Third-degree heart block (D) would present with a slow heart rate and possibly syncope due to decreased cardiac output, but the carotid pulse would be single, not double.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01088", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The patient states that he recently retired from working the day shift at a cemetery. When the patient retired, his goal was to finally be able to go out with his wife; however, he finds that he is unable to stay awake past 6 pm in the evening. His inability to stay awake has been straining his marriage as his wife is disappointed that they cannot do any activities in the evening together. The patient has tried drinking caffeine but finds that it does not help. The patient\u2019s wife claims that the patient seems to sleep peacefully, and the patient states he feels rested when he awakes. The patient has a past medical history of irritable bowel syndrome which is managed with fiber supplements. The patient\u2019s neurological exam is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? (A) Obstructive sleep apnea (B) Advanced sleep phase disorder (C) Chronic insomnia (D) Normal aging The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B]\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe patient's symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and difficulty staying awake past 6 pm, despite feeling rested upon waking, are characteristic of advanced sleep phase disorder (ASPD). ASPD is a disorder in which the body's natural sleep-wake cycle is shifted to an earlier time, resulting in the individual feeling tired in the early evening and waking up too early in the morning. This condition is often seen in older adults and can be caused by a variety of factors, including changes in the body's circadian rhythms with age.\n\nIn this case, the patient's past work schedule at a cemetery (day shift) may have helped him adjust to an earlier sleep-wake cycle, which has now become a problem since his retirement. The patient's lack of response to caffeine and the fact that he sleeps peacefully and feels rested upon waking make ASPD the most likely diagnosis.\n\nObstructive sleep apnea (A) is a condition characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep, which is not indicated in this case. Chronic insomnia (C) is a condition characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, which is not the primary issue in this case. Normal aging (D) can cause changes in sleep patterns, but the patient's symptoms are more specific and suggestive of ASPD.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01093", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Her mother reports that the patient recently received a pair of fashionable silver earrings from her older sister as a birthday present. Physical examination is only significant for erythema and tenderness over the lobules of the ears bilaterally. Her vital signs show a blood pressure of 121/73 mm Hg, heart rate of 72/min, and a respiratory rate of 21/min. Her medical history is non-significant. Of the following options, which is the mechanism of this reaction? (A) Type I\u2013anaphylactic hypersensitivity reaction (B) Type III\u2013immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction (C) Type IV\u2013cell-mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction (D) Type III and IV\u2013mixed immune complex and cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] \n\nThis patient likely has contact dermatitis due to nickel in the earrings. The reaction is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction, which occurs after 48-72 hours of exposure to the allergen. This is a classic example of a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction, also known as a cell-mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction. \n\nType I hypersensitivity reactions (A) are immediate allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis or atopic dermatitis, which occur within minutes of exposure to the allergen.\n\nType III hypersensitivity reactions (B) are immune complex-mediated reactions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or serum sickness, which occur when immune complexes deposit in tissues and trigger an inflammatory response.\n\nSince the patient has erythema and tenderness over the lobules of the ears, and this occurred after receiving new earrings, the reaction is more likely due to the delayed hypersensitivity reaction, which is Type IV.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01097", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The patient underwent menarche at age 11, and her periods were irregular every 2-3 months for two years. After that, her cycles became roughly regular every 28-35 days, but she has had extremely painful cramps and often has to miss school. The cramps are intermittent and feel like a dull ache in the center of her abdomen, and there is usually accompanying back pain. The patient has been using heating pads with limited relief. She reports some periods being \u201creally heavy\u201d and requires a superabsorbent pad every 6 hours for 2 days each cycle, but this does not limit her activities. She denies any bowel or bladder changes. The patient had normal development throughout childhood, is on the soccer team at school, and is not sexually active. Her father has hypertension and her mother has endometriosis and heavy periods. On exam, the patient is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 158 pounds (BMI 26.3 kg/m^2).

After collecting data on changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores from baseline to 12-month follow-up, he is curious if the changes in the aforementioned measurements are statistically significant. Which of the following is the most appropriate statistical method to compare the groups?\"\n\"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma\nIntroduction:\nActive asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.\nMethods:\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.\nPatients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.\nAnalyses were performed from baseline to month 12.\nResults:\nAt baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants\nPulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants\nPlacebo: 395 participants\nTable 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value\nPlaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 \u00b1 2.8 1.2 \u00b1 4.7 15.8 \u00b1 2.9 < 0.01\nLDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 \u00b1 3.6 -11.2 \u00b1 14.3 -8.4 \u00b1 3.9 0.28\nFEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 \u00b1 2.21 0.34 \u00b1 5.54 -0.22 \u00b1 3.21 0.27\nACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 \u00b1 1.22 0.46 \u00b1 3.25 0.12 \u00b1 1.33 0.43\nConclusion:\nPulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.\nSource of funding: Southeast Institute for Advanced Lung and Cardiovascular Studies, American Center for Advancement of Cardiovascular Health\" (A) Pearson correlation analysis (B) Chi-square test (C) Analysis of variance (D) Kaplan-Meier analysis The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[C] Analysis of variance (ANOVA) \n\nThis study involves comparing the means of three groups (pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, and placebo) to determine if there are any statistically significant differences in the changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores from baseline to 12-month follow-up. \n\nAnalysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method that can be used to compare the means of three or more groups to determine if there are any statistically significant differences between them.

The palpitations are accompanied by chest pain that is sharp and localized to the left 3rd intercostal space. The patient does not smoke. She drinks one to two glasses of wine on the weekends. She appears nervous. Her pulse is 110/min and irregularly irregular, and blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg. Examination shows a fine tremor on both hands and digital swelling. There is retraction of the left upper eyelid. A systolic ejection murmur is heard along the right upper sternal border. The extremities are warm, and pulses are 2+ bilaterally. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? (A) Propranolol (B) Digoxin (C) Amiodarone (D) Warfarin The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[A]\n\nRationale: This patient has symptoms and physical examination findings consistent with hyperthyroidism (e.g., tachycardia, tremor, digital swelling, and retraction of the left upper eyelid). The systolic ejection murmur is likely a result of a flow murmur secondary to the hyperdynamic circulation. The palpitations are likely due to atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, is an appropriate first-line treatment for managing the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, particularly the tachycardia and palpitations. Digoxin may also be used to control the ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation but is not as effective in managing the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication that can be used to control the ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation but is not typically used as first-line therapy. Warfarin is an anticoagulant that may be used to prevent thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation but is not indicated in this scenario.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01131", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The patient lives with his daughter and was chatting with her when suddenly his speech became distorted with random and disconnected words that made no sense. He seems to be physically frustrated that no one understands him. Physical examination demonstrates weakness of the right arm.

(A) Left frontal lobe (B) Left temporal lobe (C) Right frontal lobe (D) Right temporal lobe The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe answer is (A) Left frontal lobe.\n\nThis patient's symptoms are classic for Broca's aphasia, a type of non-fluent aphasia characterized by difficulty speaking in grammatically correct sentences, with effortful and labored speech, and often accompanied by weakness of the contralateral side of the body (in this case, the right arm). This type of aphasia is typically associated with damage to the left frontal lobe, specifically the Broca's area, which is responsible for speech production and articulation.\n\nThe left frontal lobe is responsible for language processing, and damage to this area can result in Broca's aphasia. The right frontal lobe, on the other hand, is involved in executive functions, such as planning and decision-making, and damage to this area would not explain the patient's speech changes. The left temporal lobe is involved in language processing, particularly in the comprehension of spoken language, and damage to this area would result in Wernicke's aphasia, which is characterized by fluent but meaningless speech. The right temporal lobe is not typically involved in language processing, and damage to this area would not explain the patient's symptoms.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01132", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The pain is bilateral, \u201cband-like,\u201d and extends to the neck. The patient rates the 4 points out of 10 on a visual scale. The headache is not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, and is not aggravated by movements, but gets worse when the patient coughs or laughs. The headache has persisted throughout the day and is usually worse in the morning an hour after she has breakfast and taken her medications. The patient was diagnosed with stage 1 arterial hypertension 2 years ago and stable angina pectoris 3 weeks ago. Currently, she takes aspirin (81 mg once daily), rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily), lisinopril (20 mg once daily), and isosorbide mononitrate (60 mg once daily). She has been menopausal for the last 15 years. In addition to her chief complaint, she also notes that she had a runny nose with a temperature elevation approximately 3 weeks ago, and her headache was linked to that acute illness. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 135/80 mm Hg, heart rate 76/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and temperature 36.5\u2103 (97.7\u2109). The physical examination reveals S2 accentuation that is best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border. Palpation of the paranasal sinuses is painless. The neurologic exam shows no focal symptoms, no pain on palpation of the trigeminal points, and no meningeal symptoms. What is the most likely mechanism underlying the patient\u2019s headaches? (A) Meningeal irritation by blood products originating from a chronic subdural hematoma (B) Dissection of an intracerebral vessel (C) Meningeal irritation by a growing intracranial neoplasm (D) Dilation of the intracerebral arterioles The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] \n\nExplanation: The patient's headache characteristics, such as bilateral \"band-like\" pain that worsens with coughing or laughing, suggest a secondary headache disorder. The absence of nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia, along with the lack of meningeal symptoms, makes a primary headache disorder such as migraine or tension-type headache less likely. The presence of a runny nose and temperature elevation 3 weeks prior to the onset of headache, along with the worsening of headache after breakfast and medication, suggests a possible vasodilatory effect from the patient's medications, specifically the isosorbide mononitrate. This is consistent with medication-overuse headache (MOH), which is caused by the overuse of headache-relieving medications leading to vasodilation of the intracerebral arterioles.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01133", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Over the last 2 days, she has also been experiencing a fever and drainage from the wound. On presentation, she is found to have a slightly fruity smelling red ulcer with purulent drainage. Probing the ulcer goes all the way down to bone. Which of the following characteristics is true of the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?

IFN-\u03b3 is also responsible for upregulating the expression of exogenously synthesized antigens, which are viral proteins produced by the infected cell. This makes it easier for the immune system to recognize and target the infected cell for destruction.\n\nIn this case, the patient's elevated transaminases and anti-hepatitis A virus antibodies suggest that he has been infected with hepatitis A virus, which is a common cause of viral hepatitis.

Finally, he has become extremely paranoid about government surveillance and has had hallucinations about secret agents in their house. His previous medical history is significant for a previous car crash in which the patient required internal fixation of a femur fracture and a corneal transplant for corneal degeneration. Otherwise he had no neurologic deficits prior to 6 weeks ago. Physical exam reveals myoclonus and ataxia. Which of the following is true of the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? (A) Can be transmitted on medical equipment even after autoclaving instruments (B) Contains genetic material but is unable to survive independent from a host (C) Has a cell wall containing peptidoglycan (D) Leads to intracellular aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D] \n\nThis patient's symptoms are indicative of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), a rare neurodegenerative disorder.

The symptoms described, such as rapid jerky movements (myoclonus), coordination and balance problems (ataxia), memory loss, confusion, and hallucinations, are consistent with CJD.\n\nPrions do not contain genetic material, so option B is incorrect. Prions do not have a cell wall, so option C is incorrect. Prions are also resistant to heat and can survive autoclaving, making option A incorrect. \n\nIntracellular aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are associated with Alzheimer's disease, not CJD.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01140", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He was in his usual state of health until 3 days ago when he began to complain of a sore throat as well as general malaise. The patient's past medical history reveals recurrent upper respiratory infections but no skin or soft tissue infections. The child had cardiac surgery as an infant but has otherwise been healthy. On presentation, his temperature is 100\u00b0F (37.8 \u00b0C), blood pressure is 115/72 mmHg, pulse is 65/min, and respirations are 22/min. Physical exam shows white plaques on the tongue and mouth.

They found her somnolent next to her computer and scattered pill bottles over two hours ago. The family cannot recall the types of pill bottles that they found and did not bring them to the ED. The patient's past medical history is notable for anxiety, obesity, hypertension, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. She is currently not on any medications other than an exercise program with which she is non-compliant. A physical exam is performed and is within normal limits. The patient begins communicating with the physician and states that she did take acetaminophen but it was only a few pills. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), pulse is 82/min, blood pressure is 125/85 mmHg, respirations are 11/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.

(A) N-acetylcysteine (B) Charcoal (C) IV fluids (D) Syrup of ipecac The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[B]\n\nExplanation: The patient has ingested an unknown amount of acetaminophen, but only a few pills. She does not exhibit signs of severe toxicity such as altered mental status, abdominal pain, or hypotension. Given that the exact amount of acetaminophen ingested is unknown, and the patient does not exhibit severe symptoms, the next best step is to administer activated charcoal to reduce the absorption of the ingested acetaminophen. This should be done within one hour of ingestion for maximum effectiveness. \n\nN-acetylcysteine (A) is the antidote for acetaminophen overdose, but it should be given if the patient has ingested a toxic amount (usually greater than 4 grams) and within 8-10 hours of ingestion. \n\nIV fluids (C) may be given to support the patient's hydration status, but it is not the next best step in management. \n\nSyrup of ipecac (D) is no longer recommended as a treatment for acute overdose due to the risk of aspiration and lack of efficacy.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01143", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The patient and his wife are asymptomatic and have no history of serious illness. The patient's older brother died at age 13 from heart failure and his 6-year-old nephew currently has severe muscle weakness. Genetic testing in the patient's family shows that his mother is not a carrier of the mutation that is responsible for the disease in his relatives. A pedigree chart of the patient's family is shown. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the patient not being affected? (A) Variable expressivity (B) Maternal uniparental disomy (C) Gonadal mosaicism (D) Incomplete penetrance The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nSince the patient's mother is not a carrier of the mutation and the patient's mother is not affected, the most likely explanation is that the patient's mother is a carrier of the mutation but is not expressing the disease. This is known as \"incomplete penetrance.\" However, this is not the case here.\n\nThe correct answer is (C) Gonadal mosaicism. This is a condition where there is a mixture of normal and mutated cells in the gonads (testes or ovaries), which can result in some offspring inheriting the mutation while others do not. Since the patient's mother is not a carrier of the mutation, the patient must have inherited the mutated gene from his father. However, since the patient is not affected, it is likely that his father is a mosaic for the mutation, meaning he has a mixture of normal and mutated cells in his gonads.\n\nVariable expressivity refers to the varying severity of a disease in individuals who have the same genotype, but this is not the case here.\n\nMaternal uniparental disomy refers to a situation where a person receives two copies of a chromosome from one parent and no copies from the other parent. This is not the case here, as the patient's mother is not a carrier of the mutation.\n\nIncomplete penetrance refers to the situation where some individuals with a certain genotype do not express the disease. This is not the case here, as the patient's brother and nephew are affected, indicating that the genotype is associated with the disease.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01144", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

After reviewing his medical chart, you see also see an annotation indicating no blood transfusions for religious reasons. Knowing that he needs a blood transfusion to save his life, what do you do? (A) Administer a blood transfusion to save the patient's life (B) Call the ethics board of the hospital to discuss the issue (C) Respect the patient's written instructions and do not adminster a blood transfusion (D) Convince the wife to administer a blood transfusion to her husband The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[C] \n\nThis is a complex situation, but the principle of patient autonomy is crucial. Since the patient has a written annotation in his medical chart indicating no blood transfusions for religious reasons, it is essential to respect his wishes. Although the patient is unconscious, his advance directive takes precedence over the wishes of his wife. \n\nIn this scenario, calling the ethics board (option B) might be helpful for guidance, but it does not change the fact that the patient has made his wishes clear. Administering a blood transfusion without the patient's consent (option A) would be a violation of his autonomy and potentially put him at risk of a malpractice lawsuit.

The patient refused to explain her behavior to the police. She seemed to be responding to internal stimuli when being initially interviewed. The patient has a past medical history of depression, anxiety, and obesity. The patient has a known history of medication non-compliance. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), pulse is 112/min, blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam the patient is poorly kempt and has an odd body odor. Inspection of her oropharynx reveals multiple ulcers. Cardiac exam is unrevealing with the exception of a friction rub. Since the incident, the patient has calmed down and is currently resting. She is no longer responding to internal stimuli and is more cooperative.

This patient's symptoms do not fit this diagnosis. \n\n- Eosinophilic esophagitis is characterized by difficulty swallowing and food impaction, but it is often associated with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease and eosinophilic infiltration of the esophageal mucosa. This patient's lack of response to omeprazole and absence of eosinophilic infiltration make this diagnosis less likely. \n\n- Esophageal reflux disease is characterized by symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease, such as heartburn and regurgitation.

This is consistent with the diagnosis of megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency, which is suggested by the patient's low hemoglobin level (8.6 g/dL), low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 142 fL, and low reticulocyte count (0.3%). Vitamin B12 is essential for the methylation of myelin phospholipids, and its deficiency can lead to neurological and psychiatric symptoms.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because chronic bilirubin toxicity is more likely to cause jaundice and liver dysfunction, rather than neurological and psychiatric symptoms.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because chronic acetaldehyde influence is more likely to cause symptoms related to alcohol use, such as liver damage and gastrointestinal symptoms, rather than neurological and psychiatric symptoms.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because pseudo-neurotransmitters are not a known cause of neurological and psychiatric symptoms in this patient.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01172", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Her temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 21/min, and blood pressure is 154/92 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. She is confused and oriented only to person and place. She recalls only one of three objects after 5 minutes. Her gait is unsteady. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most effective intervention for this patient's current condition? (A) Intravenous nitroprusside (B) Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (C) 100% oxygen therapy (D) Heliox therapy The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[C]\n\nRationale: The patient's symptoms of nausea, headache, agitation, and confusion, along with her unsteady gait, suggest carbon monoxide poisoning. This is likely due to the use of a gas-powered generator or a boat engine in the lakeside cabin. Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin, forming carboxyhemoglobin, which reduces the amount of oxygen delivered to tissues. The patient's symptoms are consistent with this diagnosis, and her lack of respiratory symptoms makes it difficult to diagnose. The most effective intervention for carbon monoxide poisoning is 100% oxygen therapy, which helps to displace carboxyhemoglobin and increase oxygen delivery to tissues. Intravenous nitroprusside is used to treat hypertensive emergencies, but it is not the best choice in this case. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is also used to treat carbon monoxide poisoning, but it is typically reserved for severe cases or when oxygen therapy is not effective. Heliox therapy is a mixture of helium and oxygen that is used to treat upper airway obstruction, not carbon monoxide poisoning.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01184", "gold": 3, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Menses have occurred at 45- to 90-day intervals since menarche at the age of 15 years. Her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. The patient reports that she was too embarrassed to discuss this issue with anyone until now. Over the past two years, she was unable to become pregnant despite having unprotected sexual intercourse with her husband on a regular basis. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 85 kg (187 lb); BMI is 29.4 kg/m2. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows oily skin and severe facial acne. There is abnormal pigmented hair on the upper lip and around both nipples. The patient wishes to have children. In addition to recommending lifestyle modifications, which of the following is the most appropriate step in management? (A) In vitro fertilization with patient's egg (B) Progesterone therapy (C) Clomiphene therapy (D) Leuprolide therapy The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[C]\n\nExplanation: This patient has irregular menstrual bleeding and infertility, which are classic symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, characterized by hyperandrogenism (evidenced by oily skin, severe facial acne, and abnormal pigmented hair), ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. The patient's BMI of 29.4 kg/m2 also suggests that she may benefit from weight loss, which is a lifestyle modification recommended for patients with PCOS. Clomiphene citrate is a first-line treatment for ovulatory dysfunction in women with PCOS and is the most appropriate step in management, as it stimulates ovulation and improves fertility. In vitro fertilization with the patient's egg (A) is a more invasive and expensive option that should be considered only if clomiphene therapy is unsuccessful. Progesterone therapy (B) is not an appropriate treatment for PCOS, as it does not address the underlying hormonal imbalance. Leuprolide therapy (D) is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist that is typically used to treat endometriosis and other conditions, not PCOS.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01197", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

The patient's temperature, pulse, and blood pressure are within normal limits.\n\nGiven these details, the likely cause of her symptoms would be related to anemia, as indicated by the pale conjunctivae and persistent fatigue.\n\nA peripheral blood smear is mentioned, but its specific results are not provided. However, we can infer from the options given:\n\n- Hereditary spherocytosis (A) is a genetic disorder that affects the red blood cell membrane, causing them to be sphere-shaped rather than the normal biconcave disk shape. It often presents with anemia and jaundice.\n- Vitamin B12 deficiency (B) can cause anemia, but it typically presents with neurological symptoms as well, such as numbness and tingling in the hands and feet.\n- Iron deficiency (C) is the most common cause of anemia and presents with fatigue, pale skin, and conjunctivae.\n- \u03b2-thalassemia minor (D) is a genetic disorder that affects hemoglobin production, leading to anemia. It often presents with mild anemia and may not cause significant symptoms.\n\nConsidering the patient's age, lack of major medical history, and the presence of pale conjunctivae, the most likely cause of her symptoms is iron deficiency (C).\n\nThe answer is [C].<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01202", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He says that he often gets similar pain but less severe and that it worsens with meals. The pain sometimes radiates to his back. He recently lost 15 kg (33.6 lb) of weight secondary to his lack of appetite since his last visit 2 months ago. He admits to drinking alcohol almost every night since the age of 17. His temperature is 37.0\u00b0 C (98.6\u00b0F), respirations are 15/min, pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 122/98 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals moderate epigastric tenderness. An abdominal CT scan reveals calcifications as shown by the white arrows. Which of the following organs is affected in this patient? (A) Pancreas (B) Jejunum (C) Duodenum (D) Gall bladder The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[A], [B], and [C] can be eliminated as calcifications in the pancreas and duodenum are often associated with chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, but the calcifications in these organs are usually located in the body and tail of the pancreas and the second part of the duodenum respectively, and the calcifications are usually diffuse and not focal. \n\nHowever, the calcifications in the jejunum are often associated with a rare condition called peptic ulcer disease, but the jejunum is not a common site for peptic ulcers. \n\nThe gall bladder is the organ most commonly associated with calcifications, which are known as porcelain gallbladder. Porcelain gallbladder is a condition where the gallbladder wall becomes calcified due to chronic inflammation. This condition is often associated with gallstones, which can cause chronic inflammation and lead to calcification of the gallbladder wall. The patient's history of vague upper abdominal pain that worsens with meals, and his history of gallstones (implied by his recent weight loss and lack of appetite) make this diagnosis more likely. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Gall bladder.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01203", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He has not had any changes in his weight. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic shoulder pain. Current daily medications include hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, and ibuprofen. He does not drink alcohol and does not smoke. His diet has mostly consisted of potatoes and lean meats since his wife passed away 1 year ago. His pulse is 92/min and blood pressure is 135/80 mm Hg. Examination shows conjunctival and mucosal pallor. Abdominal and rectal examination shows no abnormalities. Neurological exam shows mild postural tremor. Peripheral blood smear shows red blood cells with increased zones of central pallor and anisocytosis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient\u2019s symptoms? (A) Folic acid deficiency (B) Intravascular hemolysis (C) Impaired erythropoietin production (D) Iron deficiency The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D]\n\nThe patient's symptoms of fatigue, headache, abdominal pain, and conjunctival and mucosal pallor, along with the findings of peripheral blood smear showing red blood cells with increased zones of central pallor (target cells) and anisocytosis (variation in red blood cell size), are indicative of iron deficiency anemia. The patient's diet, which has mostly consisted of potatoes and lean meats since his wife passed away, is likely lacking in iron-rich foods. Iron deficiency anemia is a common cause of anemia in the elderly, particularly in those with limited dietary intake or chronic blood loss.\n\nFolic acid deficiency (A) can also cause anemia, but it typically presents with macrocytic anemia (large red blood cells) rather than the microcytic anemia (small red blood cells) seen in this patient.\n\nIntravascular hemolysis (B) is the destruction of red blood cells within the blood vessels, which would not explain the patient's peripheral blood smear findings or the chronic nature of his symptoms.\n\nImpaired erythropoietin production (C) can cause anemia, but it would typically be associated with a normocytic anemia (normal-sized red blood cells), which is not consistent with the patient's peripheral blood smear findings.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01206", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Her younger brother has mild developmental delay, pale complexion, and has to limit his dietary intake of phenylalanine. She has no similar symptoms and is in good health. Her parents are healthy. Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother? (A) 67% (B) 100% (C) 75% (D) 50% The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe description of her brother's symptoms suggests Phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the PAH gene. PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that a person needs to inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the disease.\n\nGiven that her brother has PKU, her parents are healthy, and she has no similar symptoms, we can infer that her parents are carriers of the mutated gene. Since the disease is autosomal recessive, each parent has a 50% chance of being a carrier. \n\nNow, considering her brother has the disease, there are three possible genotypes for her parents:\n\n1. Carrier (heterozygous): P (normal allele) / p (mutated allele)\n2. Normal (homozygous): P / P\n3. Carrier (heterozygous): p / p\n\nSince her parents are healthy, they cannot be p / p (homozygous for the mutated allele). They must be either P / P (normal) or P / p (carriers). \n\nGiven that her brother is p / p (homozygous for the mutated allele), and assuming that he inherited one mutated allele from each parent, her parents must be P / p (carriers). \n\nNow, let's calculate her carrier status:\n\n- Her mother is a carrier (P / p) with a 50% chance of passing the normal allele (P) or the mutated allele (p) to her offspring.\n- Her father is a carrier (P / p) with a 50% chance of passing the normal allele (P) or the mutated allele (p) to her offspring.\n\nSince her parents are carriers, she has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated allele (p) from each parent. Therefore, her probability of being a carrier is 50%.\n\nSo, the correct answer is: (D) 50%<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01207", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

These types of stones are often associated with conditions that increase urinary oxalate levels, such as gastrointestinal disorders or excessive dietary intake of oxalate.\n\nThe patient's history of alcoholism is also relevant, as alcoholism is associated with an increased risk of developing oxalate stones due to factors such as malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins, particularly vitamin D, which can lead to increased intestinal absorption of calcium and oxalate.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. This type of acidosis is commonly seen in patients with renal tubular acidosis (RTA) or in those with conditions that lead to increased excretion of bicarbonate, such as in the case of hyperoxaluria. The patient's presentation of flank pain and decreased urination, combined with the finding of oxalate crystals in the urine, suggests that she may have a form of RTA or another condition that leads to non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01222", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).\nResults:\nThe rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).\nConclusions:\nMepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.\nGiven the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error? (A) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error. (B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error.

The woman has CF, which is an autosomal recessive disorder. Since she has the disease, she must be homozygous recessive (let's denote the disease allele as 'c'). \n\nThe prevalence of CF in the population is 1/100, but this is the carrier frequency, not the disease frequency. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the carrier frequency is the square root of the disease frequency. Let's denote the disease frequency as 'p'. Then, the carrier frequency is \u221ap = 1/10.\n\nThe man is not described as having the disease, so he must be either homozygous dominant (let's denote the normal allele as 'C') or a carrier (Cc). \n\nThe probability that the man is a carrier is 1/2 (since the carrier frequency is 1/10, and assuming a large population, the probability of being a carrier is the carrier frequency).\n\nThe probability that the child will have the disease (Cc) is the probability that the man is a carrier multiplied by the probability that the woman is a carrier (1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4) plus the probability that the man is homozygous dominant and the woman is homozygous recessive (1/2 x 1 = 1/2).\n\nHowever, since the man is not described as having the disease, we can assume he is a carrier, so the probability that the child will have the disease is 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4. But in this scenario, the child can also be a carrier, so the probability of the child having the disease or being a carrier is 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4. Since the child can't be both homozygous dominant and homozygous recessive, the probability of the child having the disease is 1/4 * 2 = 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4 is incorrect. The correct probability is 3/4 - 1/4 = 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4 is incorrect.

The cough had been initially nonproductive. He has not had fever or chest pain. He is originally from China and visits his family there once every year. He has worked as a car salesman for 15 years and worked in a shipyard before that for 22 years. He smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily for 13 years but stopped 25 years ago. His temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F), pulse is 86/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Fine expiratory crackles are heard at both lung bases.

It leads to scarring and inflammation in the lungs, which can cause shortness of breath and cough.\n\nThe correct answer is (C) Concave flow-volume loop. This is a characteristic finding in asbestosis, reflecting the restrictive lung disease caused by scarring in the lungs. \n\n(A) Increased alveolar-arterial gradient is typically seen in conditions that affect the gas exchange in the lungs, such as pulmonary embolism or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). \n\n(B) Bloody pleural effusion is not a typical finding in asbestosis. \n\n(D) Increased diffusing capacity (DLCO) is not consistent with asbestosis, which is a restrictive lung disease.

During this period, she also has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss and has become increasingly short of breath with mild exertion. She has congestive heart failure and hypertension. Three months ago, she was in India for 3 weeks to attend a family wedding. She worked as a seamstress in a textile factory for 50 years. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 47 years. Her current medications include enalapril, digoxin, isosorbide, spironolactone, and metoprolol. She appears thin. Her temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%.

She mentions that she has tried over-the-counter lubricants, but lubricants do not seem to provide substantial relief. Her medical history is remarkable for diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. Menopause occurred at 52 years of age. She has been sexually active with her husband until recently and reports severe pain during vaginal intercourse. The physical examination reveals dry, thin, white plaque-like lesions in the vulvar area with atrophy of the labia minora. The clitoris appears retracted. The perianal skin appears pale and wrinkled.

Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects the vulvar area, characterized by thinning and scarring of the skin. It often presents with dry, thin, white plaque-like lesions and atrophy of the labia minora. The condition can cause significant discomfort and pain during sexual intercourse. The patient's history of menopause and use of hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic that can contribute to dryness and thinning of the skin, also supports this diagnosis. The other options are less likely, as squamous cell hyperplasia typically presents with thickened skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva presents with a more aggressive growth, and lichen planus typically presents with purplish, itchy, flat bumps.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01255", "gold": 0, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

This suggests that the left eye has lost its pupillary reflex, which is a normal response to light. When the left eye does not respond to light, the pupil of that eye should be dilated (mydriasis), as it is no longer constricting in response to light.

This condition is caused by a carcinoid tumor secreting serotonin, which leads to increased gut motility and secretions. The patient's history of returning from Costa Rica, a country where the disease is more prevalent, and the colonoscopy findings support this diagnosis. The patient's other medical conditions, such as bronchial asthma and bulimia nervosa, may be related to the carcinoid syndrome, which can cause flushing, diarrhea, and weight loss, among other symptoms.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01270", "gold": 1, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.

He has problems getting to sleep at night and frequently falls asleep during class. Recently he has started skipping classes altogether. He goes to bed between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. but cannot fall asleep for 2\u20133 hours. When he wakes up at 8:30 a.m., he feels extremely drowsy, and he tries to overcome his fatigue by drinking 2\u20133 cups of coffee a day. He naps at various times during the afternoon, often for more than an hour. He stopped watching videos on his smartphone at night because of suggestions from his peers. He states that he has tried over-the-counter melatonin pills and exercising at 8 p.m. without success. He has no history of serious illness. He does not smoke. He drinks three to five beers on weekends. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation for this patient? (A) Trial of diphenhydramine (B) Stop evening exercise (C) Alcoholic beverage prior to bedtime (D) Scheduled afternoon naps The answer is<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n[D]\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty falling asleep at night, and frequent napping are classic signs of sleep deprivation and possibly sleep apnea. The patient has tried melatonin and exercise, which are both appropriate initial steps for managing insomnia. The patient's use of caffeine and nicotine is also consistent with an individual who is trying to stay awake during the day. However, the most appropriate recommendation for this patient is to stop the scheduled afternoon naps, as they may be interfering with the patient's ability to fall asleep at night.<|eot_id|>"}, {"id": "test-01271", "gold": 2, "generated_response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\nAnswer the multiple-choice question about medical knowledge.
