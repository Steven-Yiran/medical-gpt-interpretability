## Instruction 1 (Same difficulty/format/length):

**Instruction:**

 You are tasked with evaluating the accuracy of a summary generated by an automatic text summarization model, such as GPT-3, BERT, or XLNet, regarding a detailed discussion on the impact of climate change on marine biodiversity. It is crucial that the summary not only remains faithful to the original content but also maintains the integrity of the scientific data presented. Given the summary and the original discussion, determine if the summary is factually consistent with the discussion. A summary is considered factually consistent only if it accurately reflects the scientific findings and data as presented in the discussion without introducing any inaccuracies or misrepresentations.

Discussion:
Dr. Smith: The latest research indicates a significant decline in coral reef health due to rising sea temperatures. Dr. Jones: Indeed, the data shows a 2°C increase in sea temperature over the past 50 years has led to widespread coral bleaching. Dr. Smith: Additionally, ocean acidification has been linked to a decrease in shellfish populations. Dr. Lee: That's correct, and the acidification is primarily due to increased CO2 absorption from the atmosphere. Dr. Jones: It's also important to note that marine biodiversity is affected by these changes, with some species facing a higher risk of extinction.

Summary:
1. Scientists have observed a decline in coral reef health, attributing it to rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification.
2. A 2°C increase in sea temperature over the past 50 years has caused widespread coral bleaching.
3. Increased CO2 absorption from the atmosphere is the main cause of ocean acidification, which affects shellfish populations.
4. Marine biodiversity is under threat, with certain species at an elevated risk of extinction due to these environmental changes.

Is the summary factually consistent with the discussion?

**Solution:**

Yes, the summary is factually consistent with the discussion. It accurately reflects the scientific findings and data presented by the scientists. The summary correctly states the decline in coral reef health due to rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification, as mentioned by Dr. Smith. It also correctly cites the 2°C increase in sea temperature over the past 50 years leading to widespread coral bleaching, as stated by Dr. Jones. Furthermore, the summary correctly attributes ocean acidification to increased CO2 absorption from the atmosphere, as explained by Dr. Lee, and acknowledges the impact on shellfish populations. Lastly, it captures the concern raised by Dr. Jones about marine biodiversity and the risk of extinction for some species.

## Instruction 2 (Much more difficult with at least 5 more constraints):

**Instruction:**

 You are to critically assess the precision of a summary produced by an advanced text summarization model, such as GPT-3, BERT, or XLNet, in relation to a complex scientific dialogue on the effects of urbanization on local bird populations. The summary must not only be factually consistent with the dialogue but also adhere to the following additional constraints: 1) It must capture the nuances of the statistical data presented, 2) It must reflect the specific species mentioned, 3) It must include the geographical area discussed, 4) It must accurately represent the time frame of the study, and 5) It must convey the causal relationships as discussed by the experts. A summary is considered precise only if it meets all these criteria without introducing any factual errors or misrepresentations.

Dialogue:
Dr. Adams: Our study in the Northeastern United States over the last decade shows a 15% decline in the population of the Eastern Bluebird due to habitat loss from urban expansion. Dr. Baker: That's concerning, especially since the data also indicates a 10% decline in the American Robin population in the same region and time period. Dr. Adams: Indeed, and the loss of native vegetation has been particularly detrimental to the habitat of the Eastern Bluebird. Dr. Carter: Additionally, the introduction of non-native plant species has altered the ecosystem, further impacting local bird populations.

Summary:
1. Urbanization has led to a decline in local bird populations, specifically the Eastern Bluebird and American Robin, in the Northeastern United States.
2. Over the last decade, there has been a 15% decline in Eastern Bluebirds and a 10% decline in American Robins, with habitat loss being a significant factor.
3. The introduction of non-native plant species has also negatively affected the local bird populations.

Is the summary precise in reflecting the dialogue, considering the additional constraints?

**Solution:**

Yes, the summary is precise in reflecting the dialogue and adheres to the additional constraints. It captures the nuances of the statistical data presented, showing specific declines in the populations of the Eastern Bluebird and American Robin. The summary also reflects the specific species mentioned and includes the geographical area discussed, which is the Northeastern United States. It accurately represents the time frame of the study, which is over the last decade. Lastly, the summary conveys the causal relationships as discussed by the experts, such as habitat loss from urban expansion and the introduction of non-native plant species impacting local bird populations.

### Follow-up Question 1:

**Question:**

How does the summary address the specific impact of urbanization on the Eastern Bluebird's habitat, as discussed by Dr. Adams?

**Solution:**

The summary addresses the specific impact of urbanization on the Eastern Bluebird's habitat by mentioning the 15% decline in the Eastern Bluebird population due to habitat loss from urban expansion, as stated by Dr. Adams. This directly reflects the causal relationship between urbanization and the decline in the Eastern Bluebird population, which is a key point in the dialogue.

### Follow-up Question 2:

**Question:**

Does the summary accurately represent the time frame of the study as discussed by the experts?

**Solution:**

Yes, the summary accurately represents the time frame of the study. It specifies that the declines in bird populations were observed over the last decade, which aligns with the time frame discussed by the experts in the dialogue.

### Follow-up Question 3:

**Question:**

In what way does the summary convey the causal relationships as discussed by the experts, particularly regarding the decline in bird populations?

**Solution:**

The summary conveys the causal relationships by linking the decline in bird populations to specific factors discussed by the experts. It mentions habitat loss from urban expansion as a significant factor for the decline in the Eastern Bluebird population and also notes the introduction of non-native plant species as an additional factor impacting local bird populations. These points directly reflect the causal relationships discussed by the experts in the dialogue.
